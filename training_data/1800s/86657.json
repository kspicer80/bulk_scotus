But, unfortunately, the District Court has adopted the system of pleading and code of practice of the State courts; and the record before us exhibits a most astonishing congeries of petitions and answers, amendments, demurrers, and exceptions, \u0097 a wrangle in writing extending over more than twenty pages, and continued nearly two years, \u0097 in which the true merits of the case are overwhelmed and concealed under a mass of worthless pleadings and exceptions, presenting some fifty points, the most of which are wholly irrelevant, and serve only to perplex the court, and impede the due administration of justice. The merits of the case, when extricated from the chaos of demurrers and exceptions in which it is enveloped, depend on two or three questions, simple and easily decided. We do not deem it necessary, therefore, to inquire whether the court below may have erred in their decision of numerous points submitted to them, which have no bearing on the merits of the case, and are of no importance to the just decision of it. It will be unnecessary <span class=\"star-pagination\">*518</span> to decide whether the judge erred in his construction of the laws of Africa!!! and other questions of a similar character, provided it shall appear that, on the admitted facts of the case, he should have instructed the jury that the defendant had established no just defence to the plaintiff's action.</p>\n<p>On the trial, the plaintiff gave in evidence two notes executed by defendant, and purporting to be for value received, payable to the plaintiff or his order. They were dated in June, 1841, and payable in one and two years. Three distinct defences were set up by defendant, which had some apparent foundation of fact to support them; a fourth, that the defendant had paid the notes to McKinney, the agent of the plaintiff, being proved to be false in fact, need not be further noticed.</p>\n<p>1st. The first was the statute of limitations, of four years, of the State of Texas.</p>\n<p>2dly. That the plaintiff had made an assignment of all his property to his creditors, and therefore had no right to recover.</p>\n<p>And 3dly. That the notes were given for the purchase of negroes imported from Africa to Cuba and thence to Texas in 1835, and consequently that the defendant had received no consideration, because the negroes, being imported contrary to law, were entitled to their freedom.</p>\n<p>We shall notice these points of defence in their order.</p>\n<p>1st. The plea of the statute of limitations was prim\u00e2 facie good, as to one of the notes, as suit had not been instituted till more than four years after it became due. But the plaintiff rebutted this plea by the exhibition of the following agreement, signed by Randon, the defendant.</p>\n<p>\"This instrument of March 14th, 1844, witnesseth: That whereas McKinney &amp; Williams, of Galveston, and Thomas F. McKinney, agent of Thomas Toby, of New Orleans, hold several notes drawn by me, and past due; and Thomas F. McKinney, some two years since, did agree for McKinney &amp; Williams, and the said Thomas Toby, to grant me further indulgence on said notes, over and above the time of their maturity; and I did then say, promise, and agree, that I would deliver to him, the said Thomas F. McKinney, each and every year, all the one half of every crop of cotton in payment, first of the amount due the said McKinney &amp; Williams, if there be any thing due them over and above the amount of purchase of negroes bought of them, and then in extinguishment of said amount of purchase of negroes, of which my note to said Toby is a part of consideration; and I further agree and oblige myself, that any surplus I may have from the proceeds of the other half of my crops, over and above my wants, exclusive of any speculations or purchase of negroes, shall also be turned <span class=\"star-pagination\">*519</span> over as above; and I further bind and obligate myself, my heirs, assigns, and administrators, that no advantage shall be taken, or any plea of statute of limitations be made, to avoid the payment of said notes, but they shall be and remain in as full force and effect as though they were renewed.</p>\n                                                     \"D. RANDON.\"\n<p>This agreement, being founded on a good consideration and accepted by the plaintiff, became incorporated in the notes, and formed a part of the contract, by mutual consent. It extended the time of payment, and the statute did not begin to run till the extended time had expired. It operated also by way of estoppel in pais to a defence under the statute of limitations. Otherwise the defendant would gain an advantage by his own fraud, or put the plaintiff to an action on the agreement. On one or the other of these principles, the doctrine of estoppel has its foundation. The plea of the statute is a breach of the agreement, and, to avoid circuity of action, it may be set up in avoidance of the plea. Moreover, the stipulation in this agreement forms a new promise on good consideration to pay the money, which has always been held as a sufficient replication to the plea of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p>It has been a subject of complaint in this case, also, that the court submitted the construction of this instrument of writing to the jury. But the defendant cannot allege this as error. First, because it was done at his own request; and secondly, because the court should have instructed the jury that the construction contended for by the defendant was wholly without foundation. The use of the word \"note,\" in the singular number, instead of \"notes,\" is so palpable a slip of the pen, that its use, although furnishing an opportunity for cavil, could not be said to create an ambiguity on the face of the instrument, or leave any doubt as to its true intent in the mind of any one who will read the whole of it together, and has no intent or desire to pervert it. It refers to \"several notes,\" it acknowledges that \"further indulgence was granted on said notes,\" and \"obligates\" the defendant not to plead the statute of limitations to \"said notes.\" Both the notes to Toby were admitted to be part of the consideration paid for the purchase of the negroes referred to in the agreement; consequently, the use of the word \"note\" was a mere error in grammar, or slip of the pen.</p>\n<p>By the settlement with McKinney and the firm, and payment of the notes held by them against the defendant, this paper became useless and inoperative as to them; but as there is no pretence that the notes of Toby were paid, the surrender of the agreement to Randon would have been a fraud on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*520</span> Toby, and the promise of McKinney to do so cannot invalidate its legal effect.</p>\n<p>2d. The record given in evidence, to show the insolvency of Toby and his assignment under the proceedings in Louisiana, after the purchase of the negroes and before the notes now in suit were given, constituted no legal defence to the action. The taking of the note payable to Toby was no fraud on the defendant; Toby was himself one of the syndics or assignees to settle his insolvent estate; he had a right to secure the debt and give an acquittance for it, and whether he took the note payable to himself individually, or as syndic, and whether he has accounted for it to his creditors, or may be bound to do it hereafter when the money is received, are questions with which the defendant has no concern whatever.</p>\n<p>3d. The plea that the notes were given for African negroes imported into Texas after the year 1833 is equally unavailable, as a matter of defence, with those already mentioned. This fact seems to have been alleged in the pleadings, as showing a want of consideration. On the argument here, it was endeavored to be supported on the ground that the notes were void, because the introduction of African negroes, both into Cuba and Texas, was contrary to law. But in neither point of view will these facts constitute a defence in the present case. If these notes had been given on a contract to do a thing forbidden by law, undoubtedly they would be void; and the court would give no remedy to the offending party, though both were in pari delicto. But Toby or his agent, McKinney, had no connection with the person who introduced the negroes contrary to law. Neither of the parties in this case had any thing to do with the original contract, nor was their contract made in defiance of law. The buying and selling of negroes, in a State where slavery is tolerated, and where color is prim\u00e2 facie evidence that such is the status of the person, cannot be said to be an illegal contract, and void on that account. The crime committed by those who introduced the negroes into the country does not attach to all those who may afterwards purchase them. It is true that the negroes may possibly, by the laws of Texas, be entitled to their freedom on that account. If the defendant bad shown that the negroes had sued out their freedom in the courts of Texas, it would have been a good defence. In every sale of personal property there is an implied warranty of title, for a breach of which a vendee may sue his vendor and recover the price paid; and on a suit for such price may plead want of consideration or eviction by a better title. But that is neither alleged nor proved in the present case. On the contrary, the defendant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*521</span> held and enjoyed the negroes, and sold them and received their value; and the negroes are held as slaves to this day, if alive, for any thing that appears on the record. As respects the defendant, therefore, he has received the full consideration for his notes, the title to his property has never been questioned, nor has he been evicted from the possession, or threatened with eviction. Consequently he has no right to set up a defence under the implied warranty of title, or for want of consideration.</p>\n<p>If the defendant should be sued for his tailor's bill, and come into court with the clothes made for him on his back, and plead that he was not bound to pay for them, because the importer had smuggled the cloth, he would present a case of equal merits, and parallel with the present; but would not be likely to have the verdict of the jury or judgment of the court in his favor.</p>\n<p>The defendant has bought these negroes in the condition of slaves de facto, with the prim\u00e2 facie evidence of their status imprinted on their forehead; he has held them as slaves, he has sold them as such, and he has no right to call upon the court in a collateral action, to which neither the slaves nor their present owners are parties, to pronounce on the question of their right to freedom, especially in support of a defence which has so little to recommend it.</p>\n<p>Having thus examined the merits of this case, and shown that the court ought to have instructed the jury to find for the plaintiff on the admitted facts of it, we think it wholly unnecessary to examine further the multitude of demurrers or exceptions spread over the record, as no decision of the court below upon them could have wronged the defendant or affected the merits of the case.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the court below is therefore affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Order.</h2>\n<p>This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the District Court of the United States for the District of Texas, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered and adjudged by this court, that the judgment of the said District Court in this cause be, and the same is hereby, affirmed, with costs and damages at the rate of six per centum per annum.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Supplementary Order.</h2>\n<p>Mr. Bibb, of counsel for the defendant in error, having stated to the court that it appeared on the face of the record of this case, that Thomas Toby was dead, that the citation was served <span class=\"star-pagination\">*522</span> on Jonas Butler, his administrator, and that the plaintiff in error had accepted such service of the citation, moved the court that the titling of the case in this court be, David Randon, Plaintiff in error, v. Jonas Butler, Administrator of Thomas Toby, deceased, and that the judgment of this court be entered in behalf of said Jonas Butler. Whereupon it is now here ordered by the court, that the said motion be, and the same is hereby, granted, and that the clerk make the entries accordingly.</p>\n</div>",

McKinney, and the firm of McKinney &amp; Williams, and for the purpose of so settling such business, and the said McLean stated that such was the purpose of his visit. After the settlement between Randon and McLean was agreed upon, witness came to Galveston at the instance of the said David Randon, for the purpose of receiving from Thomas F. McKinney a receipt in full of all claims held by the said McKinney against the said David Randon, and also a cotton obligation.

I told him that I must have it, because I was instructed to get that particularly by my uncle, David Randon. I rode out to Mr. McKinney's house, and demanded of him the cotton obligation, which he held against David Randon, and which I was requested to get. As near as I recollect, he said to me, 'I remember the obligation, but it is either lost or mislaid; but it is of no consequence in this settlement, for the receipt which I have given McLean for you includes all.' I rather insisted on his looking for it, but he said he wouldn't know where to look for it, as he had been sick for some time, and his papers were mislaid. He seemed to have no objections in the least to giving up the obligation, if he could have found it; he did not suggest any rights which he or any one else had, growing out of the said obligation. Mr. McKinney said the receipt included all, and that the obligation was of no consequence, therefore, to David Randon. David Randon sent to McKinney all the African negroes he had, except two; I think he sent twenty-one; he retained two; one he retained in accordance with the settlement, and the other he purchased and gave his note for.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'<i>Cross-examination</i>.&#8212;'The settlement, so far as witness knew, was not reduced to writing; he was present a part, but not all, of the time when the negotiation between Randon and McLean for a settlement was going on; McLean delivered to Randon some notes, but nothing else, so far as witness knew; did not know what notes they were; has heard from David Randon that they were his notes, held by Thomas F.

Said instrument (exhibit 3) was not an acknowledgment of any debt or note, according to its tenor, and could not take such debt or note out of the statute of limitations, or enable a party to recover on it. It was merely a promise to pay a debt in a particular way, viz. by delivering an amount of cotton annually. And we contend that the plaintiff cannot make said instrument available in this suit; for, as a contract, it departs from the original note, and cannot sustain it. It amounts in itself to a substantive contract, and controls the rights of the plaintiffs. See Bell <i>v.</i> Morrison, 1 Peters, 362; and Angell on Limitations, ch. 20; see also ch. 21, on Conditional Acknowledgments. This was a restricted acknowledgment or promise. It was a departure from the note, and the obligee cannot use it for the mere purpose of acknowledgment. He cannot take it as the contract of the defendant only.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, a party is entitled to recover only when he proves the existence of his claim or debt; a plaintiff is never permitted to recover, when the proof leaves the matter uncertain as to whether the debt is due or not; and in this case, if we admit that exhibit 3 refers to one or the other of the notes sued on, still, we contend, it fully appears, from the face of the instrument, that it refers to not more than one of them, and it is utterly uncertain to which it really does refer. The same argument that might be used to show that it referred to one could, word for word, be used to show that it referred to the other. Hence we contend that it cannot be applied to the first note, so as to take that out of the operation of the statute; for it amounted to no proof that this was the note to which it related.

McKinney, to whom this instrument was given, for a valuable consideration, agreed that it should be given up to Randon and discharged. This, we contend, is proved by the testimony of John Randon; and the court, we think, erred in instructing the jury that special authority from Toby to McKinney to release said instrument was necessary; and unless he was Toby's agent for this purpose, his discharge of the instrument divested Toby of no right under it. It amounted to a contract, new, distinct, and substantive. It was made with Thomas F. McKinney; he was the party to it, and we contend that he had a right to release it, unless Randon knew that his authority had ceased, and that he was acting fraudulently; and we contend that his contract to give it up vacated all rights under it. The presumption was that McKinney continued to act as the agent of Toby until Randon was notified to the contrary.

It is clear from the law of Spain, contained in the transcript, that, had these negroes been slaves in Africa (of which there is certainly no proof), still they would have become free on their arrival in Cuba. Then they contined free, unless they were made slaves by the constitution of the late republic of Texas; and in order that this should have occurred, three things must have existed, viz.:&#8212;1st, they must have been slaves for life previous to their emigration to Texas; 2d, they must have been held in bondage when the constitution was adopted; 3d, they must have been 'the <i>bon a fide</i> property of the person so holding them.' Now, in the first place, we contend that these negroes were free when they were exported from Cuba to Texas. In the second place, we contend that the constitution means only to make those persons slaves who were lawfully held in bondage; it could not be otherwise than that these were tortuously held in bondage. And, in the third place, they being free in Cuba, they could by no possibility whatever, either on that island or in Texas, have become slaves for life; and therefore could not have become the <i>bon a fide</i> property of the person holding them. Besides, the term 'emigration,' used in the constitution, could not have been intended to mean persons who were imported into Texas for traffic, either mediately or immediately, from the coast of Africa. The whole object and intention of this clause of the constitution seems to have been, to make such as were slaves for life in the United States when they emigrated slaves in Texas. This view of the subject is, we think, sustained by the whole section, and is very strongly sustained by the last portion, which provides that 'the importation or admission of Africans or negroes into the republic, excepting from the United States of America, is for ever prohibited, and declared to be piracy.' And we contend that the court erred in charging, in effect, that the constitution intended to make slaves of persons who were free before their arrival in Texas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VII.

The court erred in charging that the Gold Coast, Slave Coast, &amp;c., are inconsiderable parts of Africa, and proof that slavery existed in one part afforded a presumption that it existed in another part. This, we contend, is repugnant alike to reason and to experience. If a similar case were to be tried in any court in Europe, would proof that slavery existed in Maryland amount to proof that it existed also in Massachusetts? Yet this presumption would be much more reasonable than the charge of the court, for these States are under the same general government, and the different tribes in Africa are all independent, and are generally hostile towards each other.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, this charge expressly violates that provision of the statute of Texas which provides, that 'the judge shall not in any case, civil or criminal, charge or comment on the weight of the evidence or testimony,' &amp;c.

The instrument recites 'several notes,' held by McKinney &amp; Williams, and Thomas F.

McKinney, upon Randon's promise then to appropriate half his crops every year to pay the amount due said McKinney &amp; Williams, if there be any thing due them over and above the amount of purchase of negroes bought of them, and 'then in extinguishment of said amount of purchase of negroes.' From this recital it is plain that there were 'several notes,' not two only, upon which the indulgence had been granted; and that the 'several notes,' 'past due,' upon which the indulgence had been so obtained some two years before, were all drawn in consideration 'of the amount of purchase of negroes'; and that the proceeds of half the crops were to be applied, secondly, 'in extinguishment of said amount of purchase of negroes.' So the 'several notes' were in consideration 'of said amount of purchase of negroes.' All the several notes were included in the arrangement of 1844 for payment by the addition of the other half of the crops; all were included in the promise, 'that no advantage shall be taken, or any plea of statute of limitations be made to avoid the payment of said notes, but they shall be and remain in as full force and effect as though they were renewed.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shall the expressions 'several notes,' 'farther indulgence on said notes,' 'said amount of purchase of negroes,' no advantage of the statute of limitations 'to avoid the payment of said notes,' but 'they shall be' as though they were 'renewed,' be passed over and made nugatory, by harping solely upon the words 'of which my note to said Toby is a part of consideration'?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sages of the law, in the exposition of treaties, pacts, statutes, testaments, deeds, and other instruments, have used and handed down to us rules which are commended as the dictates of enlightened reason and common sense, whereof the following will suffice for the present, viz.:&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p142\">\n      <span class=\"num\">142</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'That the construction be made on the entire instrument, and that one part of it doth help to expound another, and that every word (if it may be) may take effect and none be rejected, and that all the parts do agree together, and there be no discordance therein.

The bar, by the statute of limitations, was the mischief to arise from further indulgence; the remedy intended was, that no advantage of the statute should be taken; that the notes should remain in as full force and effect as if renewed. But the exposition insisted on is for the purpose of inflicting the very mischief which the instrument intended to avoid; to apply the remedial agreement to the note payable at twenty-four months, not barred by the statute, and exclude note No. 2, payable at twelve months, that it may be barred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\"><i>Third Bill of Exceptions</i>.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p150\">\n      <span class=\"num\">150</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Randon had, by plea upon plea and amendment upon amendment, averred that the only consideration for the notes sued on was African negroes imported into Texas, and sold by said Toby or his agent, and after he had adduced T.

Said witness answered, 'that it referred to both of the promissory notes sued on, being the same filed with amended petition, marked 1 and 2'; thereupon the counsel for Randon moved the court, 'that the said evidence of the said McKinney should be ruled out and withdrawn from the jury, because the same was contradictory to the said writing marked No. 3, as aforesaid, which it pretended to explain; the said writing referring only to one note from David Randon to Thomas Toby.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p151\">\n      <span class=\"num\">151</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The construction of the instrument insisted on by that objection is still founded upon the one word 'note,' the one idea 'my note,' culled out and separated from the body of the instrument, as if the true reading and sense did not save from the statute of limitations the whole debt in arrear for the purchase of the negroes, as well the balance due to Toby for his interest in the negroes, as the balance due to McKinney &amp; Williams upon the note to them of September 1st, 1840, which was also given for the purchase of the negroes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p152\">\n      <span class=\"num\">152</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That the instrument No. 3 refers to the whole amount of the purchase of the negroes, which had been divided into parts, the one part payable to McKinney &amp; Williams, the other payable to Thomas Toby upon the two notes to him for his interest in the negroes, is the legal construction of the instrument. The answer of the witness Thomas F. McKinney, that the instrument referred to both the notes to Toby, is consistent with the legal construction of the instrument when applied to the facts existing at its date; it is not altering nor contradicting the instrument by any new secret averment, but is in accord with its true meaning and legal effect,&#8212;with the sound exposition of the instrument viewed in all its parts. The words, 'of which my note to said Toby is a part of consideration,' are explained by the antecedent and consequent parts to mean, 'of which my <i>debt</i> to said Toby is part of consideration of the amount of purchase of negroes.' The word 'note' means token of a debt, paper given in confession of a debt, and may well be used as a noun collective (<i>nomen collectivum</i>) to signify a debt upon one consideration divided into two parts, payable at different days.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p153\">\n      <span class=\"num\">153</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court could not have given the opinion that McKinney's testimony contradicted the instrument No. 3, without falsifying fact and law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\"><i>Sixth Bill of Exceptions</i>.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p154\">\n      <span class=\"num\">154</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This subject is again moved in the sixth bill of exceptions, by two instructions asked of the court and refused.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p155\">\n      <span class=\"num\">155</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'1st.

The chronological order of events shows that at the filing of the petition and schedule, 8th October, 1840, and at the acceptance thereof by the creditors, at the time of the discharge given by the creditors, and at the time of the confirmation of all those proceedings by the order of the court of 27th November, 1840, the interest of Thomas Toby in the negroes in Texas had been sold, and that interest was included in the note given by Randon to McKinney &amp; Williams, of 1st September, 1840, so that Toby had only an unexpressed, latent, equitable interest in the chose in action for $10,949.48, executed by Randon to McKinney &amp; Williams, which included Toby's interest, and also the interest of the other cotenants in the negroes previously sold to Randon. This interest of Thomas Toby in the choses in action, payable to McKinney &amp; Williams, was never severed until the notes now sued on, dated 21st June, 1841, were executed by Randon to Thomas Toby.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p181\">\n      <span class=\"num\">181</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon these facts the law is clear that the latent, equitable, undivided interest of Thomas Toby in the chose in action, payable to McKinney &amp; Williams, was not assignable, did not pass by the proceedings in Louisiana from Toby to his creditors, and was not required by the laws of Louisiana to have been assigned by Toby to his creditors, under the said proceedings and <i>cessio bonorum</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p182\">\n      <span class=\"num\">182</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A debt as between debtor and creditor is indivisible without the consent of both.

But, unfortunately, the District Court has adopted the system of pleading and code of practice of the State courts; and the record before us exhibits a most astonishing congeries of petitions and answers, amendments, demurrers, and exceptions,&#8212;a wrangle in writing extending over more than twenty pages, and continued nearly two years,&#8212;in which the true merits of the case are overwhelmed and concealed under a mass of worthless pleadings and exceptions, presenting some fifty points, the most of which are wholly irrelevant, and serve only to perplex the court, and impede the due administration of justice. The merits of the case, when extricated from the chaos of demurrers and exceptions in which it is enveloped, depend on two or three questions, simple and easily decided. We do not deem it necessary, therefore, to inquire whether the court below may have erred in their decision of numerous points submitted to them, which have no bearing on the merits of the case, and are of no importance to the just decision of it. It will be unnecessary to decide whether the judge erred in his construction of <i>the laws of Africa!!!</i> and other questions of a similar character, provided it shall appear that, on the admitted facts of the case, he should have instructed the jury that the defendant had established no just defence to the plaintiff's action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p188\">\n      <span class=\"num\">188</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the trial, the plaintiff gave in evidence two notes executed by defendant, and purporting to be for value received, payable to the plaintiff or his order. They were dated in June, 1841, and payable in one and two years. Three distinct defences were set up by defendant, which had some apparent foundation of fact to support them; a fourth, that the defendant had paid the notes to McKinney, the agent of the plaintiff, being proved to be false in fact, need not be further noticed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p189\">\n      <span class=\"num\">189</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1st. The first was the statute of limitations, of four years, of the State of Texas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p190\">\n      <span class=\"num\">190</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2dly.

That the notes were given for the purchase of negroes imported from Africa to Cuba and thence to Texas in 1835, and consequently that the defendant had received no consideration, because the negroes, being imported contrary to law, were entitled to their freedom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p192\">\n      <span class=\"num\">192</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We shall notice these points of defence in their order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p193\">\n      <span class=\"num\">193</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1st. The plea of the statute of limitations was <i>prim a facie</i> good, as to one of the notes, as suit had not been instituted till more than four years after it became due. But the plaintiff rebutted this plea by the exhibition of the following agreement, signed by Randon, the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p194\">\n      <span class=\"num\">194</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'This instrument of March 14th, 1844, witnesseth: That whereas McKinney &amp; Williams, of Galveston, and Thomas F. McKinney, agent of Thomas Toby, of New Orleans, hold several notes drawn by me, and past due; and Thomas F. McKinney, some two years since, did agree for McKinney &amp; Williams, and the said Thomas Toby, to grant me further indulgence on said notes, over and above the time of their maturity; and I did then say, promise, and agree, that I would deliver to him, the said Thomas F. McKinney, each and every year, all the one half of every crop of cotton in payment, first of the amount due the said McKinney &amp; Williams, if there be any thing due them over and above the amount of purchase of negroes bought of them, and then in extinguishment of said amount of purchase of negroes, of which my note to said Toby is a part of consideration; and I further agree and oblige myself, that any surplus I may have from the proceeds of the other half of my crops, over and above my wants, exclusive of any speculations or purchase of negroes, shall also be turned over as above; and I further bind and obligate myself, my heirs, assigns, and administrators, that no advantage shall be taken, or any plea of statute of limitations be made, to avoid the payment of said notes, but they shall be and remain in as full force and effect as though they were renewed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p195\">\n      <span class=\"num\">195</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'D. RANDON.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p196\">\n      <span class=\"num\">196</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This agreement, being founded on a good consideration and accepted by the plaintiff, became incorporated in the notes, and formed a part of the contract, by mutual consent. It extended the time of payment, and the statute did not begin to run till the extended time had expired. It operated also by way of estoppel <i>in pais</i> to a defence under the statute of limitations. Otherwise the defendant would gain an advantage by his own fraud, or put the plaintiff to an action on the agreement. On one or the other of these principles, the doctrine of estoppel has its foundation. The plea of the statute is a breach of the agreement, and, to avoid circuity of action, it may be set up in avoidance of the plea. Moreover, the stipulation in this agreement forms a new promise on good consideration to pay the money, which has always been held as a sufficient replication to the plea of the statute of limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p197\">\n      <span class=\"num\">197</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It has been a subject of complaint in this case, also, that the court submitted the construction of this instrument of writing to the jury. But the defendant cannot allege this as error. First, because it was done at his own request; and secondly, because the court should have instructed the jury that the construction contended for by the defendant was wholly without foundation. The use of the word 'note,' in the singular number, instead of 'notes,' is so palpable a slip of the pen, that its use, although furnishing an opportunity for cavil, could not be said to create an ambiguity on the face of the instrument, or leave any doubt as to its true intent in the mind of any one who will read the whole of it together, and has no intent or desire to pervert it. It refers to 'several notes,' it acknowledges that 'further indulgence was granted on said notes,' and 'obligates' the defendant not to plead the statute of limitations to 'said notes.' Both the notes to Toby were admitted to be part of the consideration paid for the purchase of the negroes referred to in the agreement; consequently, the use of the word 'note' was a mere error in grammar, or slip of the pen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p198\">\n      <span class=\"num\">198</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the settlement with McKinney and the firm, and payment of the notes held by them against the defendant, this paper became useless and inoperative as to them; but as there is no pretence that the notes of Toby were paid, the surrender of the agreement to Randon would have been a fraud on Toby, and the promise of McKinney to do so cannot invalidate its legal effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p199\">\n      <span class=\"num\">199</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2d. The record given in evidence, to show the insolvency of Toby and his assignment under the proceedings in Louisiana, after the purchase of the negroes and before the notes now in suit were given, constituted no legal defence to the action. The taking of the note payable to Toby was no fraud on the defendant; Toby was himself one of the syndics or assignees to settle his insolvent estate; he had a right to secure the debt and give an acquittance for it, and whether he took the note payable to himself individually, or as syndic, and whether he has accounted for it to his creditors, or may be bound to do it hereafter when the money is received, are questions with which the defendant has no concern whatever.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p200\">\n      <span class=\"num\">200</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3d. The plea that the notes were given for African negroes imported into Texas after the year 1833 is equally unavailable, as a matter of defence, with those already mentioned. This fact seems to have been alleged in the pleadings, as showing a want of consideration. On the argument here, it was endeavored to be supported on the ground that the notes were void, because the introduction of African negroes, both into Cuba and Texas, was contrary to law. But in neither point of view will these facts constitute a defence in the present case. If these notes had been given on a contract to do a thing forbidden by law, undoubtedly, they would be void; and the court would give no remedy to the offending party, though both were <i>in pari delicto</i>. But Toby or his agent, McKinney, had no connection with the person who introduced the negroes contrary to law. Neither of the parties in this case had any thing to do with the original contract, nor was their contract made in defiance of law. The buying and selling of negroes, in a State where slavery is tolerated, and where color is <i>prim a facie</i> evidence that such is the <i>status</i> of the person, cannot be said to be an illegal contract, and void on that account. The crime committed by those who introduced the negroes into the country does not attach to all those who may afterwards purchase them. It is true that the negroes may possibly, by the laws of Texas, be entitled to their freedom on that account. If the defendant had shown that the negroes had sued out their freedom in the courts of Texas, it would have been a good defence. In every sale of personal property there is an implied warranty of title, for a breach of which a vendee may sue his vendor and recover the price paid; and on a suit for such price may plead want of consideration or eviction by a better title. But that is neither alleged nor proved in the present case. On the contrary, the defendant held and enjoyed the negroes, and sold them and received their value; and the negroes are held as slaves to this day, if alive, for any thing that appears on the record. As respects the defendant, therefore, he has received the full consideration for his notes, the title to his property has never been questioned, nor has he been evicted from the possession, or threatened with eviction. Consequently he has no right to set up a defence under the implied warranty of title, or for want of consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p201\">\n      <span class=\"num\">201</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the defendant should be sued for his tailor's bill, and come into court with the clothes made for him on his back, and plead that he was not bound to pay for them, because the importer had smuggled the cloth, he would present a case of equal merits, and parallel with the present; but would not be likely to have the verdict of the jury or judgment of the court in his favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p202\">\n      <span class=\"num\">202</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant has bought these negroes in the condition of slaves <i>de facto</i>, with the <i>prim a facie</i> evidence of their <i>status</i> imprinted on their forehead; he has held them as slaves, he has sold them as such, and he has no right to call upon the court in a collateral action, to which neither the slaves nor their present owners are parties, to pronounce on the question of their right to freedom, especially in support of a defence which has so little to recommend it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p203\">\n      <span class=\"num\">203</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having thus examined the merits of this case, and shown that the court ought to have instructed the jury to find for the plaintiff on the admitted facts of it, we think it wholly unnecessary to examine further the multitude of demurrers or exceptions spread over the record, as no decision of the court below upon them could have wronged the defendant or affected the merits of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p204\">\n      <span class=\"num\">204</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the court below is therefore affirmed, with costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\"><i>Order</i>.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p205\">\n      <span class=\"num\">205</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the District Court of the United States for the District of Texas, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered and adjudged by this court, that the judgment of the said District Court in this cause be, and the same is hereby, affirmed, with costs and damages at the rate of six per centum per annum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\"><i>Supplementary Order</i>.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p206\">\n      <span class=\"num\">206</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Bibb, of counsel for the defendant in error, having stated to the court that it appeared on the face of the record of this case, that Thomas Toby was dead, that the citation was served on Jonas Butler, his administrator, and that the plaintiff in error had accepted such service of the citation, moved the court that the titling of the case in this court be, David Randon, Plaintiff in error, <i>v.</i> Jonas Butler, Administrator of Thomas Toby, deceased, and that the judgment of this court be entered in behalf of said Jonas Butler. Whereupon it is now here ordered by the court, that the said motion be, and the same is hereby, granted, and that the clerk make the entries accordingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
