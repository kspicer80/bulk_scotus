CONRAD, PLAINTIFF IN ERROR,<br>\nv.<br>\nDAVID GRIFFEY.</h1></center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center></center>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*486</span> Upon this exception, the case was argued in this court by Mr. Fendall, for the plaintiff in error, and Mr. Gillet, for the defendant in error.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*490</span> Mr. Justice WOODBURY delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>In this case, there had been four bills of exception filed in the court below, but only one of them by Conrad, the plaintiff in error. We shall, therefore, proceed to dispose of that alone.</p>\n<p>It objected to the receipt in evidence of declarations, made by a witness for the original plaintiff, under the following circumstances.</p>\n<p>Griffey brought a suit against Conrad for building a mill for him to grind sugar-cane; and, among other defences set up by the latter, was that of weakness and insufficiency in the work and materials furnished. To repel this defence Griffey put in the deposition of Nutz, who was an engineer and aided and superintended the erection of the mill, and who testified to the goodness of both the work and materials.</p>\n<p>With a view to contradict and impeach him in what he thus swore, Conrad proved that this witness, soon after the completion of the mill, had given a different account, and especially of the cause of the breaking of some of the machinery; considering it to have happened from the badness of the materials.</p>\n<p>Griffey then offered to prove that the witness had since given the same statement, as to the goodness of the work and materials, which was now in his deposition. But Conrad objected to the admissibility of such evidence; and the court below overruled his exception and allowed the evidence to go to the jury.</p>\n<p>After due consideration, our opinion is, that this ruling was erroneous.</p>\n<p>The practice on this subject seems to differ much in different States, and has occasionally changed in the same State. It is sometimes modified, also, as applied to different classes of cases and witnesses.</p>\n<p>Thus, in some places, as in New York, such evidence is, as a general rule, now treated as inadmissible. Robertson v. Caw, 3 Barbour, 410; Robb v. Hackley, 23 Wend. 50; Dudley v. Bolles, 24 Wend. 465. So in Vermont. Gibbs v. Linsley, 13 Verm. 208. Though at one time in New York it was allowed, and particularly in certain criminal cases. The People v. Vane, 12 Wend. 78; Jackson v. Etz, 5 Cowen, 320.</p>\n<p>But in some other States this kind of evidence has been deemed competent. As in Massachusetts, in a criminal case, where an accomplice was a witness. Commonwealth v. Bosworth, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*491</span> 22 Pick. 397. And in Maryland, if the statements were prior in point of time. Cook v. Curtis, 6 Har. &amp; Johns. 93.</p>\n<p>In Pennsylvania, also, such statements have been admitted, without reference to their priority. As in Parker v. Gonsalus, 1 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 536; Henderson v. Jones, 10 Ib. 322. So in Indiana. Coffin v. Anderson, 4 Blackf. 398, 399. And in some other States, which need not be repeated, a similar practice appears to prevail.</p>\n<p>But in other places, as in England, such evidence, though at one time considered competent, and especially in criminal cases, (Gilb. Ev. 135; McNally's Ev. 378, 381; Bull. N.P. 294; Lutterrell v. Reynell, 1 Mod. 282), is now even there excluded. See Parker's case, 3 Doug. 242; 10 Peters, 440; 1 Phil. Ev. 2 and 3, and 230, note; 1 Starkie's Ev. 187 and note; 23 Wend. 55; 2 Phil. Ev. 445; Brazier's Case, 1 East, P.C. 444; 2 Starkie, N.P. 242.</p>\n<p>While the rule was otherwise in England, some of the State decisions already cited were expressly grounded on the rule there (see 10 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 332), and others on cases adopting that rule (4 Blackf. 398).</p>\n<p>But since the rule became changed in England, or from being doubtful became well established against the introduction of such testimony, the practice in some States, as in New York and Vermont, has been settled so as to correspond; and in this court, also, it has taken the same direction.</p>\n<p>In this court it has been held that such evidence is not admissible, if the statements were made subsequent to the contradictions proved on the other side. Ellicott v. Pearl, 10 Peters, 412, 438.</p>\n<p>That was a case from Kentucky. Yet the decision does not appear to have been made to rest on the peculiar laws or practice of that State; but on general principles, and the course pursued of late years in England.</p>\n<p>In our judicial system, perhaps the decision should not rest on any local rule, though a different principle seems involved in McNiel v. Holbrook, 12 Peters, 85, where the rule of evidence was changed by a State statute. Clark v. Sohier, 1 Woodb. &amp; Min. 368.</p>\n<p>But if it should so rest, we are not aware that in Louisiana, where this case was tried, the practice differs from what appears to be required by sound general principles, independent of any local peculiarities.</p>\n<p>So far as regards principle, one proper test of the admissibility of such statements is, that they must be made at least under circumstances when no moral influence existed to color or misrepresent them. 1 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 469; 2 Pothier on Oblig. 289; 1 Stark. Ev. 148: 1 Phil. Ev. 308.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*492</span> But when they are made subsequent to other statements of a different character, as here, it is possible, if not probable, that the inducement to make them is for the very purpose of counteracting those first uttered. 10 Peters, 440.</p>\n<p>This impairs their force and credibility, when, if made before the others, they might tend to sustain the subsequent evidence corresponding with them. 23 Wend. 52; 2 Phil. Ev. 446; 1 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 469.</p>\n<p>When made in either way, they are admissible only to sustain the credit of the witness impugned, and not as per se proof of the facts stated, and hence if made under oath, as here, but not in legal form as a deposition between these parties, they are none the more admissible, except, if prior in date, they might help to sustain the witness' credit. 10 Peters, 412; King v. Eriswell, 3 D. &amp; E. 721.</p>\n<p>In this case, then, not having been made prior in time, they do not appear on principle or precedent to be competent.</p>\n<p>Another question has been presented, arising on the record, which is not included in any of the exceptions.</p>\n<p>It is that the judgment runs against \"Daniel Frederick Conrad,\" when the writ, pleadings, and contract speak only of \"Frederick D. Conrad.\" But the judgment is for the plaintiff against \"Daniel Frederick Conrad, the defendant.\" And the name prefixed as defendant in the judgment may well be rejected as surplusage, after verdict and judgment, when the true name had been well described in the writ and pleadings.</p>\n<p>The statute of jeofails clearly cures any such defect, where, as here, it can well be understood who was meant by \"the defendant.\" 1 Stat. at Large, 91; 1 Bac. Abr., Amendment, B; 1 Peters, 23.</p>\n<p>Let the judgment below, however, be on the first ground reversed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Order.</h2>\n<p>This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Louisiana, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered and adjudged by this court, that the judgment of the said Circuit Court in this cause be, and the same is hereby, reversed, with costs, and that this cause be, and the same is hereby, remanded to the said Circuit Court, with directions to award a venire facias de novo.</p>\n</div>",

CONRAD, PLAINTIFF IN ERROR,<br>v.<br>DAVID GRIFFEY.</p>\n    <p class=\"date\">December Term, 1850</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THIS case brought up, by writ of error, from the Circuit Court of the United States for Louisiana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was only one point of evidence involved. Three exceptions were taken during the progress of the trial by the plaintiff below, but, as the verdict was in his favor, they were not argued here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the 26th of March, Conrad, being a Louisiana planter, made a contract with Griffey of Cincinnati, by which Griffey engaged to construct and set up a steam-engine and sugarmill boilers, &amp;c., upon Conrad's plantation, for $6,650, payable at different times. Griffey stipulated to have the privilege of appointing the engineer to run the engine during the rolling of the first crop.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the 23d of December, 1846, Griffey brought his action, by way of petition, against Conrad, claiming a balance of $3,781.58.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the 22d of January, 1847, Conrad filed his answer, admitting the work, but denying that it was properly performed according to contract, and alleging that he had sustained a loss of $10,000, which he claimed in reconvention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the first trial, February 23, 1848, the jury found a verdict for plaintiff for $3,000, without interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court granted a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the 20th of February, 1849, the cause came on again for trial, when the jury found a verdict for plaintiff for $3,781.58, with interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Amongst other testimony taken on the part of the plaintiff, under a commission, was that of Leonard M. Nutz, the engineer sent by Griffey to erect and work the machine. His answers to various interrogatories may be condensed as follows:&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The quality and strength of the engine were well proportioned and strong. The quality of the machinery was good. The general style and character of the whole workmanship, mill and engine, was good. It compared with others very well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By housings are meant the frame which holds or supports the rollers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I did notice particularly the housings of Mr. Conrad's mill and engine. They were sufficiently strong; they were well fitted and suited for the purposes they were intended to be used for.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I do not know of any defects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In answer to 14th interrogatory says, I was at the mill and engine, after it was started, in the capacity and employment of engineer. I was there on the 30th day of October, 1845, acting in that capacity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In answer to 15th interrogatory says, On the 30th of October we put in a spring beam, underneath the housing, and took out the ones that were there, on account of their being made of green timber and had sprung; there was nothing broke at that time; some time in November one of the housings broke, which was caused by the carelessness of one of the negroes letting a piece of iron pass in the rollers, in the carrier, which was sufficient to break any engine; I was asleep along side of the engine, and was awakened by the surge, and took out the piece of iron; the housing did not part, it only cracked, and the mill was not stopped at all on account thereof; but when the tie-bolt was put in, we stopped about 2 1/2 hours.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In answer to 17th interrogatory says, The head engineer had an assistant furnished by the planter; the head engineer watches 18 hours, the assistant 6 hours, and they two attend to the engine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In answer to 18th interrogatory says, I had an assistant, which was one of Mr. Conrad's slaves, named Tilman, furnished by Mr. Conrad.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In answer to 19th interrogatory says, The accident occurred during the watch of my assistant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In answer to 20th interrogatory says, There was no time lost, except the two hours and a half which I was putting in the tie-bolt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In answer to 21st interrogatory says, I made two new brace bolts for the housings, and continued the crop without any further detention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In answer to 22d interrogatory says, I was present during the whole time the engine was employed taking off the crop that year, and no other stoppage of the engine and mill occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This deposition was taken on the 1st of April, 1847.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant then offered the depositions of Sosthene Allain, W. Hunstock, and William Neff. It may here be mentioned that the plaintiff objected to reading what related to Nutz's statements, on the ground that the defendant, by omitting to cross-examine him, and to inquire into such of conversations, had not laid the foundation for the admission of such statements.

I have no knowledge of the information you wish, unless it be the accident of the breaking of one of the housings of his sugar-mill, and all that I can say upon the subject is, that the night when, in my candid opinion, the accident happened, I was awakened by the surging of the engine; it completely stopped under a good head of steam. I then ordered the negro man who was running the engine at the time, to examine well in the cane shute, supposing something harder than cane to have passed in the carrier, and there was found a piece of iron that broke off of one of the cane carts, wedged in front of rolls, too large to pass; in the shape was thus, _____ about 16 inches long, 1 1/2 inches wide, where it came in contact with the other, with the rolls; and from that time until I discovered the break, which was the next day, I found it difficult to keep that end of rolls tight; I then forged new tie-bolts with keys on the outer ends, to keep them firmly keyed, and by so doing we were enabled to take off the crop without losing but three hours by the break; for whilst I was forging the bolts, the engine was still running.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Previous to the breaking of the housing, we had another small stoppage, but no accident; the wall was very green, and likely to give way; under the spur-wheel stand bed-plates, which rendered it firm and secure during the season, and will always remain so under any reasonable usage; this stoppage was the 30th of October, 1845.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'If the overseer, Mr. Collins, had let Mr. D.

To both of which, to wit, the said letter and affidavit, and the said statement in presence of said Edwards, the counsel for defendant objected, that, at the time of the making of said affidavit and said verbal statements, the said Nutz was not an agent of defendant, or employed by him; that said affidavit was not made under commission, nor with any notice or opportunity on the part of defendant to cross-examine the said witness; that his said verbal statement was not made in the presence of defendant; and, lastly, that the evidence of the defendant above referred to was not an attack upon the credit of said Nutz, but was competent testimony, admissible to prove the facts attested, and did not justify the admission of statements, either verbal or written, at other times and places made by said Nutz in order to support his credit; but all said objections were overruled, and the said letter and affidavit were received, and the testimony of said Edwards, as above stated, was also received and laid before the jury; to all of which the counsel for the defendant tender this their bill of exceptions, and pray that the answers to the interrogatories of L.

Leonard N. Nutz was the 'engineer appointed to run the engine for the plaintiff.' He was thus a very important witness for the plaintiff. His deposition tends to prove, that the steam-engine, sugar-mill, and apparatus supplied by the plaintiff below were, in every respect, conformable to the contract between the parties; that the plaintiff had, on his part, fully complied with his contract, and that he was entitled to the price which he claimed under the contract, and for extra work. In short, his deposition tended to prove the plaintiff's whole case. Other witnesses deposed to the weakness and insufficiency of the machinery; and their testimony, on many points, is in direct conflict with that of Nutz.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of these points was especially important. Soon after the sugar-mill was set up, the housings, or frame on which the rollers rest, which are the foundation on which the mill works, broke; and could not be fully repaired during the entire season. In consequence of this very serious injury, the grinding was greatly delayed, and when it recommenced, the work was done much less perfectly. It became a most material subject of inquiry whether this breaking arose from the weakness of the housings, or from some cause for which the manufacturer was not liable. Nutz, in his deposition, swore that the breaking was caused by a piece of iron passing in the rollers in the carrier. Three other witnesses present, or near, at the time when the break was discovered, swore to the contrary of this. In order to induce the jury to give greater credit to Nutz's testimony than to that of the defendant's witness, the plaintiff offered to show that at other times, and to other persons, Nutz had given the same account of the breaking as that contained in his deposition. The objections set out in defendant's bill of exceptions to the admissibility of Nutz's letter of the 3d of April, 1846, and his statement in the presence of Edwards, are relied on in support of the writ of error. In some cases the credit of a witness may be supported by proof of his statements, but this is not a case within the rule. Whatever uncertainty or fluctuation may be discerned among the older authorities, the doctrine which is now well established limits the abduction of confirmatory statements to cases in which the motive of the witness is assailed or brought under suspicion. In such cases, and in such only, evidence is admitted of his having made similar statements when the imputed motive did not exist. This principle is clearly to be collected from the rule, as enunciated in different forms by the most approved writers. See Sir W. D. Evans, 2 Pothier on Obligations, 289; 1 Greenl. Ev. &#167; 469; 1 Starkie's Ev. 148, 149 (Bost. 1826); 3 Starkie's Ev. 1758; 1 Phil. Ev. 308 (ed. N. Y. 1839); 2 Phil. Ev. 445, 446 (ed. N. Y. 1849, from 9th Lond. ed.); Robb <i>v.</i> Hackley, 23 Wend. 50; 24 Wend. 465; 10 Peters, 438, 439; 1 McLean, 211, 212; 8 Wheat. 332; 24 Wend. 425, 426.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Parker's case, 3 Doug. 242, the evidence of a confirmatory statement was rejected, Buller, J. holding 'that it was clearly inadmissible, not being upon oath.' This objection being sufficient for that case, it was unnecessary for the court to go any further. But the principle is the same, whether the confirmatory statement be sworn or unsworn. In this case, the statement made in the presence of Edwards was not sworn to; and that may have been the very statement that swayed the jury. 'It is well settled that, if improper evidence be given, although it may be cumulative only, the judgment must be reversed; for we cannot say what effect such evidence may have had on the minds of the jury.' Osgood <i>v.</i> Manhattan Company, 3 Cowen, 621; cit. Marquand <i>v.</i> Webb, 16 Johns. 89. But whether the confirmatory statement was or was not sworn to, the true questions are, in either alternative, Was the statement made before the imputed or suspected motive existed? (2 Evans's Pothier, 289; 1 Phil. Ev. 308.) Was it made before 'the relation' of the witness 'to the party or to the cause' existed? (1 Greenl. Ev. &#167; 469.) Was it made 'at a time when the witness labored under no interest or influence to misrepresent the fact'? (1 Starkie's Ev. 149; 3 Ibid. 1758.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither Nutz's letter and affidavit, nor his statement in the presence of Edwards, can stand any of these tests. His credit may have been impeached, indirectly, by disproving facts sworn by him; and directly, by proof that his own statements, made when the breaking occurred, were in direct conflict with the account which he gave in his deposition. But his own position on the 3d of April, 1846, when he writ the letter, and in the spring of 1847, when he made the statement in the presence of Edwards, was the same as on the 1st of April, 1847, when he made the deposition. And in regard to his statement in the presence of Edwards, the admission of it in evidence is liable to the further objection, that it was not proved to have been before he gave his deposition. Edwards says that it was made 'in the spring of 1847'; but whether before or after the 1st of April in that year he does not say. The 'relation to the party and to the cause' which tended to bias the mind of Nutz existed in the fall of 1845, and resulted from his being employed by the plaintiff to set up and work the mill. That bias was at least as strong in April, 1846, the date of the letter, as it was in April, 1847, the date of the deposition; and, consequently, his statements at the former or any intermediate date could not legally be adduced in support of his deposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IV.

To repel this defence Griffey put in the deposition of Nutz, who was an engineer and aided and superintended the erection of the mill, and who testified to the goodness of both the work and materials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With a view to contradict and impeach him in what he thus swore, Conrad proved that this witness, soon after the completion of the mill, had given a different account, and especially of the cause of the breaking of some of the machinery; considering it to have happened from the badness of the materials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Griffey then offered to prove that the witness had since given the same statement, as to the goodness of the work and materials, which was now in his deposition. But Conrad objected to the admissibility of such evidence; and the court below overruled his exception and allowed the evidence to go to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After due consideration, our opinion is, that this ruling was erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The practice on this subject seems to differ much in different States, and has occasionally changed in the same State. It is sometimes modified, also, as applied to different classes of cases and witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, in some places, as in New York, such evidence is, as a general rule, now treated as inadmissible. Robertson <i>v.</i> Caw, 3 Barbour, 410; Robb <i>v.</i> Hackley, 23 Wend. 50; Dudley <i>v.</i> Bolles, 24 Wend. 465. So in Vermont. Gibbs <i>v.</i> Linsley, 13 Verm. 208. Though at one time in New York it was allowed, and particularly in certain criminal cases. The People <i>v.</i> Vane, 12 Wend. 78; Jackson <i>v.</i> Etz, 5 Cowen, 320.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But in some other States this kind of evidence has been deemed competent. As in Massachusetts, in a criminal case, where an accomplice was a witness. Commonwealth <i>v.</i> Bosworth, 22 Pick. 397. And in Maryland, if the statements were prior in point of time. Cook <i>v.</i> Curtis, 6 Har. &amp; Johns. 93.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Pennsylvania, also, such statements have been admitted, without reference to their priority. As in Parker <i>v.</i> Gonsalus, 1 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 536; Henderson <i>v.</i> Jones, 10 Ib. 322. So in Indiana. Coffin <i>v.</i> Anderson, 4 Blackf. 398, 399. And in some other States, which need not be repeated, a similar practice appears to prevail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But in other places, as in England, such evidence, though at one time considered competent, and especially in criminal cases, (Gilb. Ev. 135; McNally's Ev. 378, 381; Bull. N. P. 294; Lutterrell <i>v.</i> Reynell, 1 Mod. 282), is now even there excluded. See Parker's case, 3 Doug. 242; 10 Peters, 440; 1 Phil. Ev. 2 and 3, and 230, note; 1 Starkie's Ev. 187 and note; 23 Wend. 55; 2 Phil. Ev. 445; Brazier's Case, 1 East, P. C. 444; 2 Starkie, N. P. 242.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the rule was otherwise in England, some of the State decisions already cited were expressly grounded on the rule there (see 10 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 332), and others on cases adopting that rule (4 Blackf. 398).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But since the rule became changed in England, or from being doubtful became well established against the introduction of such testimony, the practice in some States, as in New York and Vermont, has been settled so as to correspond; and in this court, also, it has taken the same direction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this court it has been held that such evidence is not admissible, if the statements were made subsequent to the contradictions proved on the other side. Ellicott <i>v.</i> Pearl, 10 Peters, 412, 438.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That was a case from Kentucky. Yet the decision does not appear to have been made to rest on the peculiar laws or practice of that State; but on general principles, and the course pursued of late years in England.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our judicial system, perhaps the decision should not rest on any local rule, though a different principle seems involved in McNiel <i>v.</i> Holbrook, 12 Peters, 85, where the rule of evidence was changed by a State statute. Clark <i>v.</i> Sohier, 1 Woodb. &amp; Min. 368.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But if it should so rest, we are not aware that in Louisiana, where this case was tried, the practice differs from what appears to be required by sound general principles, independent of any local peculiarities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So far as regards principle, one proper test of the admissibility of such statements is, that they must be made at least under circumstances when no moral influence existed to color or misrepresent them. 1 Greenl. Ev. &#167; 469; 2 Pothier on Oblig. 289; 1 Stark. Ev. 148: 1 Phil. Ev. 308.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But when they are made subsequent to other statements of a different character, as here, it is possible, if not probable, that the inducement to make them is for the very purpose of counteracting those first uttered. 10 Peters, 440.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This impairs their force and credibility, when, if made before the others, they might tend to sustain the subsequent evidence corresponding with them. 23 Wend. 52; 2 Phil. Ev. 446; 1 Greenl. Ev. &#167; 469.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When made in either way, they are admissible only to sustain the credit of the witness impugned, and not as <i>per se</i> proof of the facts stated, and hence if made under oath, as here, but not in legal form as a deposition between these parties, they are none the more admissible, except, if prior in date, they might help to sustain the witness' credit. 10 Peters, 412; King <i>v.</i> Eriswell, 3 D. &amp; E. 721.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, then, not having been made prior in time, they do not appear on principle or precedent to be competent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another question has been presented, arising on the record, which is not included in any of the exceptions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is that the judgment runs against 'Daniel Frederick Conrad,' when the writ, pleadings, and contract speak only of 'Frederick D. Conrad.' But the judgment is for the plaintiff against 'Daniel Frederick Conrad, <i>the defendant</i>.' And the name prefixed as defendant in the judgment may well be rejected as surplusage, after verdict and judgment, when the true name had been well described in the writ and pleadings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute of jeofails clearly cures any such defect, where, as here, it can well be understood who was meant by 'the defendant.' 1 Stat. at Large, 91; 1 Bac. Abr., <i>Amendment</i>, B; 1 Peters, 23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let the judgment below, however, be on the first ground reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\"><i>Order</i>.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Louisiana, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered and adjudged by this court, that the judgment of the said Circuit Court in this cause be, and the same is hereby, reversed, with costs, and that this cause be, and the same is hereby, remanded to the said Circuit Court, with directions to award a <i>venire facias de novo</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
