LOUIS RAILWAY COMPANY.</h1></center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center>Submitted October 17, 1884.</center>\n<center>Decided October 27, 1884.</center>\nIN ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> <i>Mr. George Willard</i> and <i>Mr. George Driggs</i> for plaintiffs in error.</p>\n<p>No counsel appeared for defendant in error.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*36</span> MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the court. He stated the facts in the foregoing language and continued:</p>\n<p>The judgment below was clearly right. The Columbus, Chicago &amp; Indiana Central Company was, in equity, the owner of the property when the lease was made and when the Pittsburg, Cincinnati &amp; St. Louis Company went into possession under it. The deed executed in February, 1872, pursuant to the contract of purchase, converted the equitable title of the Columbus, Chicago &amp; Indiana Central Company into a legal title, which at once, by operation of law, inured to the benefit of the Pittsburg, Cincinnati &amp; St. Louis Company under its lease. All the rights of William B. Skidmore, as against the property, accrued long after those of the Pittsburg, Cincinnati &amp; St. Louis Company and are subject to the title of that company. Such being the case, it is entirely unnecessary to inquire whether the Skidmores acquired a valid title to the property as against the Columbus, Chicago &amp; Indiana Central Company. The Pittsburg, Cincinnati &amp; St. Louis Company is entitled to the possession, whether that title be good or bad.</p>\n<p><i>The judgment is affirmed.</i></p>\n</div>",
