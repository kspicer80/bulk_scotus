The suit abated as to <i>Welch</i> by the return of the marshal, that he was no inhabitant of the district. The Defendant, Moss, pleaded specially certain facts in avoidance of the bond as to him alone; upon which issue was joined; and upon the trial the Defendant, <i>Moss</i>, offered, as a witness, the said John Welch the principal obligor who was permitted by the Court below to testify for the Defendant, and upon his cross examination confessed that he had made over to Moss all his property as security to indemnify him against the event of this suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Plaintiff took a bill of exceptions, and the verdict and judgment being against him, brought his writ of error to this Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">E. I. LEE <i>and</i> JONES, <i>for the Plaintiff in error</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Welch was clearly an interested witness. By relieving Moss from this suit, he would relieve his property from the <i>lien</i> which Moss held upon it. If the Plaintiff recovered against Moss, the latter could immediately recover judgment against <i>Welch</i> for the whole debt, together with the costs of <i>this suit. Laws of Virg. Rev. Code.</i> 292.&#8212;5. <i>T. R.</i> 578, <i>Buckland v. Tankard.&#8212;Bull. N. P.</i> 283 5. <i>Bur.</i> 2727.&#8212;3. <i>Atk.</i> 402.&#8212;<i>Day.</i> 81.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Welch is also interested to the amount of his legal fees for attendance as a witness. It appears upon the record that he was regularly summoned and is by law entitled to demand of Moss one dollar and a quarter per diem. If the Plaintiff should be defeated he will retain this to his own use, but if the Plaintiff should recover judgment he will have to refund it to Moss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. LEE, <i>contra</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Defence set up by Moss did not affect Welch's liability upon the bond. He was bound at all events. He was not a party to this suit. Neither the verdict nor judgment could affect him. He would be obliged to pay either Riddle or Moss and it was immaterial to him which of them should recover against him. If the Plaintiff should be defeated by Moss, he would sue Welch and recover judgment <i>with costs</i>&#8212;so that it was immaterial to him whether he paid costs to one or the other. He therefore stood indifferent as to interest. In chancery one Defendant is a good witness for another, and it would be as good a rule at law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts of law have, of late, inclined to refer all cases of doubtful interest, to the credibility, rather than to the competency of the witness. The interest should be immediate and direct, in order to exclude the witness. 3. <i>Esp.

The United States</i>, 4 <i>Cranck</i>, 219, the point was made by a bill of exceptions to the refusal of the district court of Kentucky to admit a coobligor as a witness, but was not decided, the judgment having been reserved upon other grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>March</i> 10<i>th.
