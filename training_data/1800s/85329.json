There is a material distinction between the death of parties before judgment and after judgment, and while a writ of error is depending. In the former case, all personal actions by the common law abate, and it required the aid of some statute, like that of the thirty-first section of the Judiciary Act of 1789, ch. 20. to enable the action to be prosecuted by or against the personal representative of the deceased, when the cause of action survived. In real actions, the like principle prevails, for a still stronger reason, for, by the death of either party, the right descends to the heir, and a new cause of action springs up; and the plea is not, therefore, in the same condition as it was in the life-time of the party</p>\n<p>But, in cases of writs of error upon judgments already rendered, a different rule prevails. In personal actions, if the plaintiff in error dies before assignment of error, it is said that by the course of proceedings at common law, the writ abates, but if, after assignment of errors, it is otherwise. In this latter case, the defendant may join in error, and proceed to get the judgment affirmed, if not erroneous, and he may then revive it against the representatives of the plaintiff. But in no case does a writ of error in personal actions abate by the death of the defendant in error, whether it happen before or after errors assigned. If it happen before, and the plaintiff will not assign errors, the representatives of the defendant may have a <i>scire facias quare executio non,</i> in order to compel <span class=\"star-pagination\">*263</span> him; if it happen after, they must proceed as if the defendants were living, till judgment be affirmed, and then revive by <i>scire facias.</i> And the plaintiff, in order to compel the representatives of the defendant in error, to join in error, may sue out a <i>scire facias ad audiendum errores,</i> either generally, or naming them. Such is the doctrine of approved authorities. 2 <i>Tidd's Pr ch.</i> 43. <i>Error, p.</i> 1096 It is clear, therefore, that at common law, in these cases, a writ of error does not necessarily abate and that the personal representatives may not only be admitted voluntarily to become parties, but a <i>scire facias</i> may issue to require them to become parties.

Hardin</i>, for the defendant in error, moved to dismiss the writ of error in this case, which was a real action, upon a suggestion of the death of the demandant and plaintiff in error, pending the proceedings in this Court. He insisted that, at common law, the death of either party, any time before <i>final</i> judgment, would have abated the suit; (Tidd's Pr. 1024; Bac. Abr. tit. Abatement); that the judiciary act of 1789, c. 20. s. 31. made no provision for this case, since it merely extended to the case of the death of parties, in personal actions, before judgment; and that the statute 17 Car. II. c. 8. and the act of Kentucky, showed the sense of Parliament and the local legislature, that real actions abated by the death of the parties, before judgment, upon writ of error on judgments already rendered.</p>\n      <p class=\"center\"><i>March</i> 8<i>th.</i></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice STORY delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The preliminary question which has been argued at the bar, is, whether the writ of error in this case, which is a writ of right, has abated by the death of the demandant, who is the plaintiff in error, pending the proceedings in this Court.
