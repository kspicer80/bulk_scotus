Under this statute, it was held in <i>Piquignot</i> v. <i>The Pennsylvania Railroad Company,</i> 16 How. 104, which came from the same district as this case, that the judgment of the Circuit Court, on precisely such a plea as that contemplated by this affidavit of defence, was \"not subject to our revision on a writ of error.\" The defence is one which merely defeats the present proceeding, and does not conclude the plaintiff forever, either as to his right to sue in the Circuit Court of the United States, or as to the merits of the matter in dispute.</p>\n<p>All the other defences are covered by the decision of this court in <i>Barnet</i> v. <i>National Bank,</i> 98 U.S. 555.

The grounds of defense, as set forth in the affidavit, were: (1) That another suit was pending in the court of common pleas of Green county, Pennsylvania, between the same parties, for the same identical cause of action. (2) That the original of the note in suit was discounted and taken by the bank on the twenty-seventh of June, 1871; that the money advanced thereon at the time was only $8,434.65; that the loan was renewed by six subsequent notes, the last being the note in suit; that upon such loan and each of the renewals the bank 'knowingly took, received, reserved, and charged' usurious interest amounting in the aggregate to $3,736.50; that the defendant is only surety for Israel Stephens, the maker of the note; and that the defendant is entitled to set off the amount of the 'interest so knowingly taken, received, reserved, and charged by the bank' 'against the money loaned on the original of the note in suit.' (3) That the bank had 'knowingly taken, received, reserved, and charged at various times discount and interest, in excess of the amount permitted by its fundamental law on other loans to the principal debtor, amounting in the aggregate to $6,773.10, which was a proper set-off against the claim in this suit. (4) That the paper on which the note sued on was written was signed in blank by the parties thereto when it was taken to the bank for the purposes of renewal; that no one had authority to fill the blanks for anything else than the exact amount due on the original note, after deducting all payments, and that it was filled by an officer of the bank for the sum of $9,500, when, in view of the usury taken, less than $6,000 was due.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first of these defenses, it is sufficient to say that the plea of another action pending is a plea in abatement.
