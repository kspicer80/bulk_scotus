The issue was joined upon the question whether the petitioners <i>were entitled to their freedom</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon the trial of this issue, in the Court below, the Plaintiff in error, <i>Wood</i>, tendered a bill of exceptions which stated that it was admitted that the petitioners were the children of <i>Susan Davis;</i> and they produced the record of the judgment in favor of their mother <i>Susan Davis</i> against Caleb Swann, (in which case her petition stated that she was born free, being descended from a white woman; and the issue joined was upon the question whether she was <i>free</i> or a <i>slave</i>.) And it was admitted that Susan Davis had been sold by Wood to Swann before the judgment; whereupon the petitioners, by their counsel, prayed the Court to direct the jury, that the record aforesaid and the matters so admitted <i>were conclusive evidence for the petitioners in this cause;</i> and the Court directed the jury as prayed: to which direction the Defendant, Wood, excepted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">F. S. KEY, <i>for the Plaintiff in error, contended</i>,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. That Wood was not a party, nor privy to any party, to the suit of <i>Susan Davis</i> against Swann, and is, therefore, not concluded by the judgment in that case: and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. That the judgment was only proof, that Susan Davis was free at the time of the judgment; not that she was <i>born</i> free, and therefore it did not appear that she was free at the time of the birth of the petitioners. She might have been manumitted after the birth of her children, and so entitled to her freedom at the time of the judgment, and yet the petitioners might remain slaves. The only issue ever joined in Maryland (under the laws of which state this case was tried) upon a petition for freedom, is, whether the petitioner be <i>free</i> at the time of issue joined&#8212;not whether she were <i>born</i> free&#8212;2. <i>Harris's Entries</i>, 530. It is immaterial what title is set out in the petition. The petitioner is not confined to it, but may, on the trial, show any other title to freedom&#8212;the practice in Maryland is merely to state in the petition that the petitioners is entitled to freedom and is holden as a slave. The act of assembly of Maryland, of 1796, directs that the jury shall be charged to determine those allegations in the petition <i>which may be controverted</i>. The only allegation controverted is that the petitioner <i>is free</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DUVAL, <i>J.</i> stated that in all the petitions which he filed in Maryland, in the cases of the <i>Shorters</i>, the <i>Thomases</i>, the <i>Bostons</i>, and many others, he always stated their title at large, tracing it up to a free white woman; and after judgment in those cases, the Courts always held, that the subsequent petitioners who claimed under the same title, were only bound to prove their descent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. LEE, <i>contra</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue in <i>Susan</i> Davis's case is, in fact, whether she was <i>born free</i>. And the case of <i>Shelton v. Barbour</i>, 2. <i>Wash.</i> 64, shows that the verdict is conclusive as to all claiming under the same title. Wood's title was the same as Swann's&#8212;and that of the petitioners the same as that of Susan Davis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">F.

There was no privity between them, as to the children. Swann could do nothing to injure Wood's title to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>March</i> 10<i>th.
