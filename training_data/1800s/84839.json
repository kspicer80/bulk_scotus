T. Frost</i>, and <i>Lund Washington</i> as sureties, conditioned that she should prosecute her appeal upon four several judgments rendered against her by a justice of peace in Maryland. <i>William Oneale</i>, the defendant below, pleaded <i>non est factum</i>, and upon the trial of that issue took a bill of exceptions, because the court below (two judges only being present, and divided in opinion) did not, at his request, instruct the jury, 'that if they should be satisfied by the evidence that the bonds were signed, sealed and delivered by <i>Mary Sweeny</i> as principal, and <i>I. T. Frost</i> and the <i>defendant</i> as her sureties, and were afterwards presented to <i>C. C.</i> (the justice who had rendered the judgments) for his approbation and acceptance of the securities, and were by him <i>refused and rejected</i>, and after such rejection were <i>interlined</i>, without the license, privity and knowledge of the defendant, by inserting the name of <i>Lund Washington</i> as a co-obligor, who on the succeeding day, without the privity, knowledge and consent of the defendant, signed, sealed and delivered the bonds, which were afterwards approved of by the justice, that then such interlineation and execution of said bonds by <i>Lund Washington</i> rendered them void as to the defendant, and the plaintiff cannot recover in this suit.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the <i>act of Maryland</i>, 1791, <i>c.</i> 68. &#167; 5. no execution upon a judgment of a justice of peace shall be stayed by an appeal, unless the person appealing, or some other in his behalf, 'shall, immediately upon making such appeal, enter into bond, with sufficient sureties, <i>such as the justice by whom judgment shall be given shall approve of</i>, in double the sum recovered, with condition,' &amp; c.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>P.

The alteration of the deeds by the interlineation was in a matter essential; it made them the deeds of four, when they were only the deeds of three persons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is immaterial whether the alteration is for the benefit of the obligor; the only question is, whether it substantially vary the deeds. <i>Esp.

After the rejection of the bonds by the justice, they could never be set up again, without a new delivery by the defendant. <i>5 Co.</i> 19. (<i>b) Whelpdale's case</i>. The justice was substituted by the law for the obligee, and his rejection is equally fatal as if the bonds had been tendered to, and refused by the obligee himself. <i>Shep. Touch.</i> 70. It might have been that the defendant held a counter security, which he released upon the rejection of the bond.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mason</i>, contra, contended,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That the interlineation was not material, and being made by a third person without the privity of the obligee, did not vacate the deeds, especially as it was for the benefit of the defendant. 11 <i>Co.</i> 27. <i>Henry Pigot's case.

This is in the nature of a judicial proceeding, and not a mere matter of contract between man and man. It is a security required by law in a civil action.
