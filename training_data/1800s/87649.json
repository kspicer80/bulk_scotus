Carlisle and J.S. Brown, contra.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*301</span> Mr. Justice NELSON delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p>As the two stockholders (Rockwell and Fleming), though not made defendants by the bill, were permitted, by leave of the court, to appear and put in answers in the name of the Milwaukie and Minnesota Company, it is material to inquire into the effect to be given to them. That they cannot <span class=\"star-pagination\">*302</span> be regarded as the answers of the corporate body is manifest, as a corporation must appear and answer to the bill, not under oath, but under its common seal. And an omission thus to appear and answer according to the rules and practice of the court, entitle the complainants to enter an order that the bill be taken pro confesso. A further objection to the practice of permitting a party to appear and answer in the name of the corporation is the inequality that would exist between the parties to the litigation. The corporation not being before the court, it would not be bound by any order or decree rendered against it, nor by any admissions made in the answer or stipulations that might be entered into by the parties or their counsel. It is thus apparent, that while the name of the corporation is thus used as a real party in the litigation so far as the rights and interests of the complainants are concerned, it is an unreal and fictitious party so far as respects any obligation or responsibility on the part of the respondents.</p>\n<p>It is insisted, however, that the directors of this company refused to appear and defend the bill filed against them, and for the fraudulent purpose of sacrificing the interests of the stockholders; and, hence, the necessity, as well as the propriety and justice, of permitting the defence by a stockholder in their name.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, in the case supposed, it would be a reproach to the law, and especially in a court of equity, if the stockholders were remediless. But in such a case, the court in its discretion will permit a stockholder to become a party defendant, for the purpose of protecting his own interests against unfounded or illegal claims against the company, and he will also be permitted to appear on behalf of other stockholders who may desire to join him in the defence. But this defence is independent of the company and of its directors, and the stockholder becomes a real and substantial party to the extent of his own interests and of those who may join him, and against whom any proceeding, order, or decree of the court in the cause is binding, and may be enforced. It is true, the remedy is an extreme one, and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*303</span> should be admitted by the court with hesitation and caution; but it grows out of the necessity of the case and for the sake of justice, and may be the only remedy to prevent a flagrant wrong. A complainant, if he chooses, may compel a corporation to appear and answer by a writ of distringas; or he may join with the corporation, a director, or officer, if he desires a discovery under oath. But we are not aware of any other except a complainant who can compel an appearance or answer.</p>\n<p>Now, although the appearance and answers of the stockholders (Rockwell and Fleming) were irregularly allowed by the court, as each was permitted to appear and answer in the name of the company, yet, as the defence set up is doubtless the same as that which they would have relied on if they had been admitted simply as stockholders, we are inclined to regard the answers the same as if put in by them in that character, in the further views we shall take of the case. Each one swore to the truth of his answer in the usual way.</p>\n<p>Before we enter upon an examination of the merits of the case, it will be proper to dispose of the CROSS-BILL filed by Fleming against the complainants.</p>\n<p>This bill was filed in the name of the company alone, signed by their solicitors and counsel. The name of Fleming does not appear. And in addition to this, it appears that Fleming, in his petition for leave to appear and answer the bill in the name of the company, also asked leave to file a cross-bill. Leave was granted to put in the answer, but not to file the bill. The filing of it subsequently, therefore, was an irregularity for which the court below very properly afterwards set it aside. The cross-bill, so much spoken of on the argument, is thus out of the case. In this connection we may as well refer to the answers of the judgment creditors, who were made parties defendant to the bill of complaint.</p>\n<p>Sebre Howard recovered a judgment in the United States District Court, on the 28th November, 1859, against the La <span class=\"star-pagination\">*304</span> Crosse and Milwaukie Railroad Company, for the sum of $16,379.86; and Graham &amp; Scott, a judgment in a State court of Wisconsin, on the 25th November, 1858, against the same company for the sum of $29,820.71; and another judgment in the same court, on the 21st September, 1858, for the sum of $11,188.15; and also a judgment against the same company, in the United States District Court, on the 11th January, 1860, for the sum of $44,413.18. This latter judgment appears from the answer, as we understand it, to have been founded on the two previous judgments in the State court. Now, it appears that each of these judgments were recovered after the date of the third mortgage of the La Crosse and Milwaukie Company, upon the foreclosure of which the Milwaukie and Minnesota Company was formed. The liens of these judgments were subsequent to this mortgage, and were cut off by its foreclosure. Indeed, the judgment of Howard, of November, 1858, and the last judgment of Graham &amp; Scott, which was recovered in 1860, never were liens upon any interest in the road of the La Crosse and Milwaukie Company, the defendants in the judgments, as the equity of redemption had already passed to the purchaser under the sale to Barnes in the foreclosure of the third mortgage, and afterwards became vested in the Milwaukie and Minnesota Company. These judgment creditors, therefore, according to their answers, have no interest in the subject-matter of this litigation. We may add, that as replications were filed to the answers, the proof of these judgments should have been produced at the hearing. But the only proof of them that we have found in the record, is in a list of judgments annexed to the report of the master. They were material, and were put in issue by the replication.</p>\n<p>These answers of the judgment creditors being thus disposed of, the issues in the case are brought down to those raised by the answers of Rockwell and Fleming, in the name of the Milwaukie and Minnesota Company, which we have agreed to consider rather by indulgence than as matter of strict right, as the answers of the individual stockholders. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*305</span> And this brings us to an examination of what may be called the merits of the case.</p>\n<p>Before we take up the questions presented by these answers to the bill which bear upon the merits, it will be proper to refer to some matters there presented, and very much discussed on the argument, which, in our judgment, should be laid entirely out of the case, as tending only to confuse and embarrass the real questions involved. We refer to those parts of the answers which relate to the dealings between the La Crosse and Milwaukie Company and Chamberlain, in which the complainants in this suit were not concerned, and with which they had no connection, as, for instance, the lease of the road to Chamberlain, and the allegation of fraud against him and against the company in conducting the business of running the road under this lease. Also, in respect to other contracts between these parties in relation to the indebtedness of the company to Chamberlain, and to the building and completion of unfinished portions of the road, and equipping it with the rolling stock for use. These relate to the dealings of the mortgagor, the La Crosse and Milwaukie Company, with a third person, over which the complainants, as mortgagees, had no control, and for which they were not responsible. These dealings were subsequent to the execution and lien of the mortgage, and could not affect prejudicially the rights of the mortgagees. They had no interest in the earnings of the road, or concern in the appropriation of them, until the filing of the bill and the appointment of a receiver.</p>\n<p>The only matters, therefore, set forth in these answers, and in the proofs, which have any bearing on the merits, are:</p>\n<p>1. The allegation that Chamberlain received from the La Crosse and Milwaukie Company two hundred of the bonds secured by this mortgage fraudulently and without consideration.</p>\n<p>2. That S.R. Foster received one hundred of the bonds in the same way.</p>\n<p>3. That J.T. Soutter, one of the trustees, received fifty five of them, and refused to deliver them to the company.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*306</span> 4. That Greene C. Bronson, the other trustee, received fifteen for the stock of the company.</p>\n<p>5. That Prentiss Dow, an officer of the company, received fourteen for less than one thousand dollars.</p>\n<p>And 6. That Chamberlain, who had covenanted, in the lease of the road from the company, to apply the proceeds derived from the use of it to the payment of the interest accruing on the bonds, withheld the payment in pursuance of a fraudulent arrangement with the trustees, or with their agents, for the purpose of bringing about a foreclosure of the mortgage, that he might be enabled to purchase the road.</p>\n<p>These are the allegations that bear upon the merits of the controversy, and deserve to be considered. We shall not, however, encumber this opinion with any very detailed explanation of them, but shall briefly refer to the proofs relating to each of these charges.</p>\n<p>1. As to Chamberlain. It appears that he held a large claim for damages against the company, on account of their failure to fulfil contracts made with him to build the Western Division of the road. The work on the road was suspended by reason of this failure. And in the fall of 1857, upon the issue of the bonds of the company, under this second mortgage, an arrangement was entered into by the company, by which he received these two hundred bonds, at fifty cents on the dollar, towards payment of this claim.</p>\n<p>2. As to S.R. Foster. He had loaned the company over one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, and had taken their bonds as security, and, among others, the one hundred in question. It appears that, at a meeting of the Board of Directors, 24th May, 1858, the matter between them was adjusted by delivery of forty land-grant bonds to Foster.</p>\n<p>3. As to T.J. Soutter. The fifty-five bonds in controversy between him and the company were settled, as appears by a receipt of their chairman and vice-president, on 14th September, 1858, by the delivery of other bonds to the company.</p>\n<p>4. As to G.C. Bronson. He had purchased fifteen thousand dollars of stock, one hundred and fifty shares, from the company, in the spring of 1857, and paid eighty cents cash on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*307</span> the dollar, the president at the time agreeing that the company would repurchase it at the same rate, at any time thereafter, if he should wish to surrender it back. The company was, doubtless, pressed for money at the time. At a meeting of the Board of Directors, on the 2d of September, 1858, it was resolved, that it would take into consideration the stock theretofore purchased by Judge Bronson, as he rendered many services to the company for which he had received no compensation; and afterwards, in September of the same year, it appears that the president of the company, who had induced him to purchase the stock, received it back, and delivered to him the fifteen bonds in question. The truth of the case, therefore, is, that instead of receiving from the company the money he had advanced for the stock, according to their agreement, he received in place of it only bonds of the company of less than half the value; and, as it appears, nothing for his legal advice and services.</p>\n<p>5. As to Prentiss Dow. It appears that but thirteen bonds had been received by him, and for which he paid the company, at the time, $11,400 in cash, stock, and other bonds, and was afterwards engaged in its service as agent, settling claims against the company.</p>\n<p>In this connection, it is proper to refer to the terms, as published in a circular by the La Crosse and Milwaukie Company, and under which these bonds were negotiated and put into circulation. This paper is dated August 10th, 1857. The company state, that the importance of completing the road this season to the junction of the Western Division (sixty miles from Portage), by which they would not only control the coming winter's travel of the Upper Mississippi, but receive over 300,000 acres of the land grants, have determined the Board of Directors to place before the stock and bondholders extraordinary inducements to furnish the means; that the sum of $400,000 would be required. To obtain this sum, the company now offers the holders of its stock and of unsecured bonds, a new issue of one million of 8 per cent. bonds, &amp;c. The terms proposed are, to receive in payment for a bond of $1000, $400 in cash, and the like <span class=\"star-pagination\">*308</span> sum in the stock or unsecured bonds of the company. It was upon these terms that the directors went into the market, in the city of New York and elsewhere, for the purpose of negotiating the bonds which now constitute the subject of litigation.</p>\n<p>6. As to the charge of collusion of the complainants with Chamberlain, in the proceedings to foreclose the mortgage. This allegation is founded upon an agreement entered into with Chamberlain, on the 13th of November, 1859. At the time of this agreement he was in possession of the road, and in the receipt of its earnings, and the obvious object of it, on the part of the trustees, was to procure the control of the net proceeds of its earnings, pending the proceedings of foreclosure. For this purpose, Chamberlain agreed to deposit the whole of the earnings with the agent of the trustees, from day to day; and the trustees, on their part, agreed to appropriate them to the objects and uses provided for in the lease, as the exigencies and proper working of the road might require. The trustees, in order to secure the fidelity of the officers and agents of Chamberlain, connected with the earnings of the road and the receipt of its revenues, stipulated for a supervision and control over these persons, and for the discharge of any of them from the service, in case of a dereliction of duty. They provided, also, for access to the books and papers relating to the revenues, management, and running of the road; also, for the appointment of a receiver, in case of the non-fulfilment of the agreement on the part of Chamberlain. These provisions were very important, as the revenues of the road, according to the terms of the lease, after covering running expenses and paying the interest on prior incumbrances, were to be applied to the discharge of the interest on these second mortgage bonds. The interest then due on them amounted to $40,000. It was also agreed that the proceedings of foreclosure should be conducted amicably; that is, no unreasonable opposition should be made to them by Chamberlain. It was further agreed that the sale should be made, if practicable, subject to the lease of Chamberlain, and that no <span class=\"star-pagination\">*309</span> opposition should be made to his purchase of the road at the sale under the foreclosure; but the trustees expressly reserved the right to bid at the sale for the protection of the bondholders. The trustees also agreed that, in case Chamberlain should become the purchaser, they would extend a credit of nine and twenty-four months upon so much of the interest as had become due.</p>\n<p>It is supposed that the arrangement was entered into for the fraudulent purpose of enabling Chamberlain to purchase the road at the foreclosure sale, and thereby cut off subsequent incumbrances, and especially the rights and interests of the Milwaukie and Minnesota Company, formed under the third mortgage. But there is no evidence of this charge in the proofs, nor even of any previous dealings between the parties, tending to this conclusion. They came together for the first time after the trustees had determined to foreclose the mortgage for default in the payment of interest, and finding Chamberlain in the possession of the road, and refusing to deliver it over to the trustees, as provided for in the mortgage, but, on the contrary, insisting upon his right to run the same pending the legal proceedings, it is not strange that the trustees should have endeavored to arrange with him for a supervision and control, in the meantime, over the earnings and management of the road, and that he should forbear any unreasonable opposition to the foreclosure suit. And as to the provision relating to the purchase in case of a sale, there is nothing in it interfering with any rights that belonged to the trustees, or to the prejudice of third parties, the judgment creditors, or company formed under the third mortgage. In a word, the arrangement was highly beneficial to the bondholders represented by the trustees, and prejudicial to no one concerned in the foreclosure suit.</p>\n<p>We shall not, however, dwell longer on this branch of the case; indeed, much that we have thus far said has been rather by way of explanation, and for the purpose of clearing it of matters and issues that do not belong to it, and have served only to confuse and embarrass its consideration. In view of this object and purpose, we have referred to the two <span class=\"star-pagination\">*310</span> answers of the stockholders, Rockwell and Fleming, and have endeavored to separate the irrelevant matter from that which bore upon the merits, so as to confine the examination to the latter, namely, to the charges against the validity of the bonds impeached, of the number of some three hundred and eighty, in the hands, or which passed into the hands of several individuals named, and have shown, as we think, by a reference to the proofs, that these charges are not well founded. The general and sweeping allegations against the other portion of the bonds, without specification or identity, we have not specially noticed. These charges are too general to be entitled to consideration, and the proofs relied on are as general and indefinite as the allegations.</p>\n<p>We have also shown that the judgment creditors who appeared and answered have no interest in the matters in controversy; and, lastly, that the charges of a fraudulent collusion between the trustees and Chamberlain rest upon suspicion instead of upon proofs.</p>\n<p>We now come to a branch of the case which presents a more conclusive answer to all the charges, whether in allegations or in proofs of the respondents, and overrides all other views that may or can be taken of them.</p>\n<p>As we have seen, this third mortgage, under which the Milwaukie and Minnesota Company was formed, was executed and delivered to Barnes, the trustee, on the 22d June, 1858, to secure the payment of an issue of $2,000,000 in bonds, and a supplement to this mortgage was executed to the same trustee, on the 11th August following.</p>\n<p>These two mortgages, or rather one in two parts, were, in express terms, made subject, among other incumbrances mentioned, to the bonds secured by a second mortgage on the Eastern Division of the road, to the amount of one million of dollars.</p>\n<p>Again, the bonds issued under this third mortgage, one of which is in the proofs, have an indorsement on the back, as follows: \"State of Wisconsin, La Crosse and Milwaukie Railroad Company, third mortgage sinking fund bond, seven per cent., <span class=\"star-pagination\">*311</span> &amp;c.;\" subject, among other things, \"to a second mortgage on the same line of road of $1,000,000.\"</p>\n<p>At the time this third mortgage was executed, and thus made subject to the second mortgage bonds, all these bonds had been negotiated by the company, and were in circulation in the business community. They were all negotiated in the months of September, October, November, and December, 1857. This, the company, of course, well knew at the time of the execution of the third mortgage, and knew, also, of the circumstances attending the negotiation of them. They had received and were in the enjoyment of the avails of them, and with this knowledge, and under these circumstances, the third mortgage, and the bonds issued under it, were made in express terms subject to the payment and satisfaction of the bonds issued under the second. All persons, therefore, taking these third mortgage bonds, or coming in under the mortgage, took them and came in with a full knowledge that the mortgagor had made the security subject to the prior lien and indebtedness. Even if there had been any valid objection to these bonds under the second mortgage, it was competent for the obligor to waive them, and no better proof could be furnished of the waiver, than the acknowledgment of the full indebtedness, by making the subsequent security subject to it. This was a question that belonged to the obligor to determine for himself when giving the third mortgage; but, besides this, what right have those coming in under it to complain? They come in with full notice of the acknowledgment of the indebtedness and previous lien; and, especially, what right have the Milwaukie and Minnesota Company to complain, who purchased the equity of redemption through Barnes, their agent, subject to the previous incumbrances of $1,000,000. They have the benefit of that incumbrance by an abatement of that amount in the price of the purchase.</p>\n<p>Without pursuing the case further, we are satisfied the decree of the court below, reducing the indebtedness of the La Crosse and Milwaukie Company to the bondholders, is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*312</span> erroneous, and that the decision should have been for the full amount of one million of dollars, and interest.</p>\n<p>WE SHALL, THEREFORE, REVERSE the decree, and remit the cause to the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Wisconsin, with directions to enter a decree for all the interest due and secured by the mortgage, with costs; that the court ascertain the amount of moneys in the hands of the receiver or receivers from the earnings of the road covered by the mortgage, which may be applicable to the discharge of the interest, and apply it to the same; and that if the moneys thus applied are not sufficient to discharge the interest due on the first day of March, 1864, then to ascertain the balance remaining due at that date, and in case such balance is not paid within one year from the date of the order of the court ascertaining it, then an order shall be entered directing a sale of the mortgaged premises, under the direction of the court, and on bringing the proceeds into court, they shall be applied to the payment of the balance of interest; and if they exceed such balance, shall be applied to the future accruing interest down to the sale; and if they exceed that, to the principal of the bonds, in case the bondholders assent, or pro rata to those who may assent, and any remaining balance of the proceeds to be invested, under the direction of the court, for the payment of future accruing interest, and ultimately the principal.</p>\n<p>AND FURTHER, that in case the interest upon the bonds is paid without a sale, the decree shall remain as security for subsequent accruing interest, and ultimately for the principal.</p>\n<p>AND FURTHER, that the court may pay out of moneys in the hands of the receiver, or out of the proceeds, the taxed costs of the trustees in the proceedings for the foreclosure of the mortgage, not taxed and received from the defendants in those proceedings; and also such counsel fees in behalf of the trustees, as the court, in its discretion, may seem right to allow.</p>\n<p>DECREE ACCORDINGLY.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  This case was decided at the last term.</p>\n\n</div>",

The cross-bill, so much spoken of on the argument, is thus out of the case.

This latter judgment appears from the answer, as we understand it, to have been founded on the two previous judgments in the State court. Now, it appears that each of these judgments were recovered after the date of the third mortgage of the La Crosse and Milwaukie Company, upon the foreclosure of which the Milwaukie and Minnesota Company was formed. The liens of these judgments were subsequent to this mortgage, and were cut off by its foreclosure. Indeed, the judgment of Howard, of November, 1858, and the last judgment of Graham &amp; Scott, which was recovered in 1860, never were liens upon any interest in the road of the La Crosse and Milwaukie Company, the defendants in the judgments, as the equity of redemption had already passed to the purchaser under the sale to Barnes in the foreclosure of the third mortgage, and afterwards became vested in the Milwaukie and Minnesota Company.

But the only proof of them that we have found in the record, is in a list of judgments annexed to the report of the master. They were material, and were put in issue by the replication.</p>\n<p>These answers of the judgment creditors being thus disposed of, the issues in the case are brought down to those raised by the answers of Rockwell and Fleming, in the name of the Milwaukie and Minnesota Company, which we have agreed to consider rather by indulgence than as matter of strict right, as the answers of the individual stockholders. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*305</span> And this brings us to an examination of what may be called the merits of the case.</p>\n<p>Before we take up the questions presented by these answers to the bill which bear upon the merits, it will be proper to refer to some matters there presented, and very much discussed on the argument, which, in our judgment, should be laid entirely out of the case, as tending only to confuse and embarrass the real questions involved. We refer to those parts of the answers which relate to the dealings between the La Crosse and Milwaukie Company and Chamberlain, in which the complainants in this suit were not concerned, and with which they had no connection, as, for instance, the lease of the road to Chamberlain, and the allegation of fraud against him and against the company in conducting the business of running the road under this lease. Also, in respect to other contracts between these parties in relation to the indebtedness of the company to Chamberlain, and to the building and completion of unfinished portions of the road, and equipping it with the rolling stock for use. These relate to the dealings of the mortgagor, the La Crosse and Milwaukie Company, with a third person, over which the complainants, as mortgagees, had no control, and for which they were not responsible. These dealings were subsequent to the execution and lien of the mortgage, and could not affect prejudicially the rights of the mortgagees. They had no interest in the earnings of the road, or concern in the appropriation of them, until the filing of the bill and the appointment of a receiver.</p>\n<p>The only matters, therefore, set forth in these answers, and in the proofs, which have any bearing on the merits, are:</p>\n<p>1. The allegation that Chamberlain received from the La Crosse and Milwaukie Company two hundred of the bonds secured by this mortgage fraudulently and without consideration.</p>\n<p>2. That S.R. Foster received one hundred of the bonds in the same way.</p>\n<p>3. That J.T. Soutter, one of the trustees, received fifty five of them, and refused to deliver them to the company.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*306</span> 4. That Greene C. Bronson, the other trustee, received fifteen for the stock of the company.</p>\n<p>5. That Prentiss Dow, an officer of the company, received fourteen for less than one thousand dollars.</p>\n<p>And 6. That Chamberlain, who had covenanted, in the lease of the road from the company, to apply the proceeds derived from the use of it to the payment of the interest accruing on the bonds, withheld the payment in pursuance of a fraudulent arrangement with the trustees, or with their agents, for the purpose of bringing about a foreclosure of the mortgage, that he might be enabled to purchase the road.</p>\n<p>These are the allegations that bear upon the merits of the controversy, and deserve to be considered. We shall not, however, encumber this opinion with any very detailed explanation of them, but shall briefly refer to the proofs relating to each of these charges.</p>\n<p>1. As to Chamberlain. It appears that he held a large claim for damages against the company, on account of their failure to fulfil contracts made with him to build the Western Division of the road. The work on the road was suspended by reason of this failure. And in the fall of 1857, upon the issue of the bonds of the company, under this second mortgage, an arrangement was entered into by the company, by which he received these two hundred bonds, at fifty cents on the dollar, towards payment of this claim.</p>\n<p>2. As to S.R. Foster. He had loaned the company over one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, and had taken their bonds as security, and, among others, the one hundred in question. It appears that, at a meeting of the Board of Directors, 24th May, 1858, the matter between them was adjusted by delivery of forty land-grant bonds to Foster.</p>\n<p>3. As to T.J. Soutter. The fifty-five bonds in controversy between him and the company were settled, as appears by a receipt of their chairman and vice-president, on 14th September, 1858, by the delivery of other bonds to the company.</p>\n<p>4. As to G.C. Bronson. He had purchased fifteen thousand dollars of stock, one hundred and fifty shares, from the company, in the spring of 1857, and paid eighty cents cash on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*307</span> the dollar, the president at the time agreeing that the company would repurchase it at the same rate, at any time thereafter, if he should wish to surrender it back. The company was, doubtless, pressed for money at the time. At a meeting of the Board of Directors, on the 2d of September, 1858, it was resolved, that it would take into consideration the stock theretofore purchased by Judge Bronson, as he rendered many services to the company for which he had received no compensation; and afterwards, in September of the same year, it appears that the president of the company, who had induced him to purchase the stock, received it back, and delivered to him the fifteen bonds in question. The truth of the case, therefore, is, that instead of receiving from the company the money he had advanced for the stock, according to their agreement, he received in place of it only bonds of the company of less than half the value; and, as it appears, nothing for his legal advice and services.</p>\n<p>5. As to Prentiss Dow. It appears that but thirteen bonds had been received by him, and for which he paid the company, at the time, $11,400 in cash, stock, and other bonds, and was afterwards engaged in its service as agent, settling claims against the company.</p>\n<p>In this connection, it is proper to refer to the terms, as published in a circular by the La Crosse and Milwaukie Company, and under which these bonds were negotiated and put into circulation. This paper is dated August 10th, 1857. The company state, that the importance of completing the road this season to the junction of the Western Division (sixty miles from Portage), by which they would not only control the coming winter's travel of the Upper Mississippi, but receive over 300,000 acres of the land grants, have determined the Board of Directors to place before the stock and bondholders extraordinary inducements to furnish the means; that the sum of $400,000 would be required. To obtain this sum, the company now offers the holders of its stock and of unsecured bonds, a new issue of one million of 8 per cent. bonds, &amp;c. The terms proposed are, to receive in payment for a bond of $1000, $400 in cash, and the like <span class=\"star-pagination\">*308</span> sum in the stock or unsecured bonds of the company. It was upon these terms that the directors went into the market, in the city of New York and elsewhere, for the purpose of negotiating the bonds which now constitute the subject of litigation.</p>\n<p>6. As to the charge of collusion of the complainants with Chamberlain, in the proceedings to foreclose the mortgage. This allegation is founded upon an agreement entered into with Chamberlain, on the 13th of November, 1859. At the time of this agreement he was in possession of the road, and in the receipt of its earnings, and the obvious object of it, on the part of the trustees, was to procure the control of the net proceeds of its earnings, pending the proceedings of foreclosure. For this purpose, Chamberlain agreed to deposit the whole of the earnings with the agent of the trustees, from day to day; and the trustees, on their part, agreed to appropriate them to the objects and uses provided for in the lease, as the exigencies and proper working of the road might require. The trustees, in order to secure the fidelity of the officers and agents of Chamberlain, connected with the earnings of the road and the receipt of its revenues, stipulated for a supervision and control over these persons, and for the discharge of any of them from the service, in case of a dereliction of duty. They provided, also, for access to the books and papers relating to the revenues, management, and running of the road; also, for the appointment of a receiver, in case of the non-fulfilment of the agreement on the part of Chamberlain. These provisions were very important, as the revenues of the road, according to the terms of the lease, after covering running expenses and paying the interest on prior incumbrances, were to be applied to the discharge of the interest on these second mortgage bonds. The interest then due on them amounted to $40,000. It was also agreed that the proceedings of foreclosure should be conducted amicably; that is, no unreasonable opposition should be made to them by Chamberlain. It was further agreed that the sale should be made, if practicable, subject to the lease of Chamberlain, and that no <span class=\"star-pagination\">*309</span> opposition should be made to his purchase of the road at the sale under the foreclosure; but the trustees expressly reserved the right to bid at the sale for the protection of the bondholders. The trustees also agreed that, in case Chamberlain should become the purchaser, they would extend a credit of nine and twenty-four months upon so much of the interest as had become due.</p>\n<p>It is supposed that the arrangement was entered into for the fraudulent purpose of enabling Chamberlain to purchase the road at the foreclosure sale, and thereby cut off subsequent incumbrances, and especially the rights and interests of the Milwaukie and Minnesota Company, formed under the third mortgage. But there is no evidence of this charge in the proofs, nor even of any previous dealings between the parties, tending to this conclusion. They came together for the first time after the trustees had determined to foreclose the mortgage for default in the payment of interest, and finding Chamberlain in the possession of the road, and refusing to deliver it over to the trustees, as provided for in the mortgage, but, on the contrary, insisting upon his right to run the same pending the legal proceedings, it is not strange that the trustees should have endeavored to arrange with him for a supervision and control, in the meantime, over the earnings and management of the road, and that he should forbear any unreasonable opposition to the foreclosure suit. And as to the provision relating to the purchase in case of a sale, there is nothing in it interfering with any rights that belonged to the trustees, or to the prejudice of third parties, the judgment creditors, or company formed under the third mortgage. In a word, the arrangement was highly beneficial to the bondholders represented by the trustees, and prejudicial to no one concerned in the foreclosure suit.</p>\n<p>We shall not, however, dwell longer on this branch of the case; indeed, much that we have thus far said has been rather by way of explanation, and for the purpose of clearing it of matters and issues that do not belong to it, and have served only to confuse and embarrass its consideration. In view of this object and purpose, we have referred to the two <span class=\"star-pagination\">*310</span> answers of the stockholders, Rockwell and Fleming, and have endeavored to separate the irrelevant matter from that which bore upon the merits, so as to confine the examination to the latter, namely, to the charges against the validity of the bonds impeached, of the number of some three hundred and eighty, in the hands, or which passed into the hands of several individuals named, and have shown, as we think, by a reference to the proofs, that these charges are not well founded. The general and sweeping allegations against the other portion of the bonds, without specification or identity, we have not specially noticed. These charges are too general to be entitled to consideration, and the proofs relied on are as general and indefinite as the allegations.</p>\n<p>We have also shown that the judgment creditors who appeared and answered have no interest in the matters in controversy; and, lastly, that the charges of a fraudulent collusion between the trustees and Chamberlain rest upon suspicion instead of upon proofs.</p>\n<p>We now come to a branch of the case which presents a more conclusive answer to all the charges, whether in allegations or in proofs of the respondents, and overrides all other views that may or can be taken of them.</p>\n<p>As we have seen, this third mortgage, under which the Milwaukie and Minnesota Company was formed, was executed and delivered to Barnes, the trustee, on the 22d June, 1858, to secure the payment of an issue of $2,000,000 in bonds, and a supplement to this mortgage was executed to the same trustee, on the 11th August following.</p>\n<p>These two mortgages, or rather one in two parts, were, in express terms, made subject, among other incumbrances mentioned, to the bonds secured by a second mortgage on the Eastern Division of the road, to the amount of one million of dollars.</p>\n<p>Again, the bonds issued under this third mortgage, one of which is in the proofs, have an indorsement on the back, as follows: \"State of Wisconsin, La Crosse and Milwaukie Railroad Company, third mortgage sinking fund bond, seven per cent., <span class=\"star-pagination\">*311</span> &amp;c.;\" subject, among other things, \"to a second mortgage on the same line of road of $1,000,000.\"</p>\n<p>At the time this third mortgage was executed, and thus made subject to the second mortgage bonds, all these bonds had been negotiated by the company, and were in circulation in the business community. They were all negotiated in the months of September, October, November, and December, 1857. This, the company, of course, well knew at the time of the execution of the third mortgage, and knew, also, of the circumstances attending the negotiation of them. They had received and were in the enjoyment of the avails of them, and with this knowledge, and under these circumstances, the third mortgage, and the bonds issued under it, were made in express terms subject to the payment and satisfaction of the bonds issued under the second. All persons, therefore, taking these third mortgage bonds, or coming in under the mortgage, took them and came in with a full knowledge that the mortgagor had made the security subject to the prior lien and indebtedness. Even if there had been any valid objection to these bonds under the second mortgage, it was competent for the obligor to waive them, and no better proof could be furnished of the waiver, than the acknowledgment of the full indebtedness, by making the subsequent security subject to it. This was a question that belonged to the obligor to determine for himself when giving the third mortgage; but, besides this, what right have those coming in under it to complain? They come in with full notice of the acknowledgment of the indebtedness and previous lien; and, especially, what right have the Milwaukie and Minnesota Company to complain, who purchased the equity of redemption through Barnes, their agent, subject to the previous incumbrances of $1,000,000. They have the benefit of that incumbrance by an abatement of that amount in the price of the purchase.</p>\n<p>Without pursuing the case further, we are satisfied the decree of the court below, reducing the indebtedness of the La Crosse and Milwaukie Company to the bondholders, is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*312</span> erroneous, and that the decision should have been for the full amount of one million of dollars, and interest.</p>\n<p>WE SHALL, THEREFORE, REVERSE the decree, and remit the cause to the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Wisconsin, with directions to enter a decree for all the interest due and secured by the mortgage, with costs; that the court ascertain the amount of moneys in the hands of the receiver or receivers from the earnings of the road covered by the mortgage, which may be applicable to the discharge of the interest, and apply it to the same; and that if the moneys thus applied are not sufficient to discharge the interest due on the first day of March, 1864, then to ascertain the balance remaining due at that date, and in case such balance is not paid within one year from the date of the order of the court ascertaining it, then an order shall be entered directing a sale of the mortgaged premises, under the direction of the court, and on bringing the proceeds into court, they shall be applied to the payment of the balance of interest; and if they exceed such balance, shall be applied to the future accruing interest down to the sale; and if they exceed that, to the principal of the bonds, in case the bondholders assent, or pro rata to those who may assent, and any remaining balance of the proceeds to be invested, under the direction of the court, for the payment of future accruing interest, and ultimately the principal.</p>\n<p>AND FURTHER, that in case the interest upon the bonds is paid without a sale, the decree shall remain as security for subsequent accruing interest, and ultimately for the principal.</p>\n<p>AND FURTHER, that the court may pay out of moneys in the hands of the receiver, or out of the proceeds, the taxed costs of the trustees in the proceedings for the foreclosure of the mortgage, not taxed and received from the defendants in those proceedings; and also such counsel fees in behalf of the trustees, as the court, in its discretion, may seem right to allow.</p>\n<p>DECREE ACCORDINGLY.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  This case was decided at the last term.</p>\n\n</div>",

This Barnes mortgage, with a supplement to it, was made to secure an issue of bonds to the amount of TWO millions of dollars.

In pursuance of this order, Rockwell filed his answer, entitled 'The separate answer J. S.

These six instances being connected with the names of, 1st, Chamberlain; 2d, one S. R. Foster; 3d, J. T. Souter, a trustee and complainant; 4th, Greene C. Bronson, another trustee and complainant; 5th, one Prentiss Dow. The 6th charge had reference to a certain leasing of the road to Chamberlain.

R. Foster, of the city of New York, as a security for a <i>pretended</i> indebtedness of said company to him, but that, in truth and in fact, said company was not indebted to said Foster, on a fair settlement of accounts, in any sum whatever, but that said Foster was largely indebted to said company; that about fifty-five of said bonds were delivered to the said complainant, J. T. Souter, either without any consideration at all, or as collateral security to or in exchange for certain bonds of the said company, theretofore issued corruptly and fraudulently, and without any legal authority whatever, by the said company, and popularly known as 'Corruption Bonds,' or 'Barstow Bonds,' and that said Souter gave no valid or valuable consideration therefor, but that the said transfer to him of the said fifty-five bonds was fraudulent; that fifteen of said bonds were delivered to the complainant, G. C. Bronson, in exchange for stock of the said company, and was pretended to have been sold to him for the stock of said company, which stock was at the time nearly or wholly worthless; and this defendant insists that neither the said company, nor its directors, officers, or agents, had any authority, power, or right whatever to purchase from said Bronson said stock for or on behalf of said company, and pay therefor with money or property or bonds of said company, and that said pretended sale of said fifteen bonds to said Bronson was illegal and fraudulent; that about six hundred of said bonds were sold and disposed of at the nominal price of 80 cents on the dollar, as follows, viz: forty cents on the dollar of the amount specified in the said bonds, respectively, was to be paid in money, and forty cents on the dollar of said amount in the bonds of said company, known as aforesaid as 'Barstow Bonds,' or in the said bonds known as 'Corruption Bonds,' or in the stock of said company; and that the said company received for said six hundred bonds only about one hundred and ninety thousand dollars in cash, and that it received in said bonds known as 'Barstow Bonds' and 'Corruption Bonds,' and mostly in said Barstow bonds, so-called, about one hundred thousand dollars, and the remainder, to make up said eighty cents on the dollar, in the stock of said company; and this defendant insists that neither the said company, nor its directors, officers, or agents, had any authority, power or right to sell said bonds and receive the capital stock of said company in part payment therefor, and that all of said six hundred bonds, disposed of as aforesaid, are fraudulent and void, and ought to be surrendered and cancelled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The answer further stated that one <i>Prentiss Dow</i>, who was an agent of the company, received fourteen of the bonds for a sum less than one thousand dollars.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It then set forth the circumstances attending a certain <i>leasing of the road</i> by the La Crosse and Milwaukie Company to Chamberlain, and the delivery of possession of he same, with its rolling stock and appurtenances generally. According to the terms of the lease referred to, Chamberlain bound himself, after paying the interest and existing claims arising out of prior liens and incumbrances, to apply the net proceeds of the road to the accruing interest on the bonds secured by the mortgage to the complainants. And the allegation of the defendant was, that Chamberlain and the complainants, or their agents, combined to withhold the payment of the interest, for the purpose and with the intent of forcing a sale of the road and its appurtenances, under the mortgage, for the benefit of Chamberlain, that he might become the purchaser; and that the present suit was instituted in pursuance of this arrangement; that Chamberlain had funds in his hands, the proceeds of the road, to pay the interest coupons due the 1st of September, 1859. The answer then set out the title of the Milwaukie and Minne sota Company under the foreclosure of the third mortgage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The answer of Rockwell, the other stockholder, was substantially the same as that of Fleming.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence in regard to these facts was very voluminous and intricate, making what the court styled 'a <i>most</i> complicated and difficult case.'<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> It filled a volume of more than one thousand large pages of small pica, set 'solid.' The facts, too, were resolutely contested, the argument in this court, and chiefly upon them, having lasted six days. It is not possible to present here the evidence of them. As assumed by the court in the result and truth to have been proved, they were in substance somewhat thus, though this was not exactly the view taken of them by Mr. M. H. Carpenter, counsel of the defendants to the bill, who collocated, presented, and enforced the evidence of irregular dealing with singular eloquence and force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>As respected Chamberlain</i>. This person, who had been a contractor on the western part of the road, held a claim for damages against the company, on account of their failure to fulfil their contracts made with him; a failure which arrested the progress of the work. In the autumn of 1857, upon the issue of the bonds of the company under this second mortgage, an arrangement was entered into by the company, by which he received, towards payment of this claim, the two hundred bonds in question; not at par, but <i>at fifty cents on the dollar</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>As respected S. R. Foster</i>. He had lent to the company more than one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, and had taken their bonds as security. Among them were the one hundred in question. At a meeting of the board of directors, 24th of May, 1858, the matter between the parties was adjusted by delivery to him of forty bonds, called 'land grant bonds.' The terms on which he held them were not distinct; but it was not shown that he paid what is called their 'face;' in other words, their par.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>As respected J. T. Souter</i>. The fifty-five bonds in controversy between him and the company were settled, as appeared by a receipt of one Guest, their chairman and vice-president, on 14th of September, 1858, by the delivery of other bonds to the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. <i>As respected G. C. Bronson</i>. He had purchased fifteen thousand dollars worth of stock from the company in the spring of 1857, and <i>paid eighty cents, cash, on the dollar</i>, the president, at the time, agreeing that the company would repurchase it at the same rate at any time thereafter, if he should wish to surrender it back. In September, 1858, they did take it back; and for this, delivered to him the fifteen bonds. A meeting of the board of directors on the 2d of that same September had resolved that it would take into consideration the stock theretofore purchased by Judge Bronson, as he had rendered many services to the company, for which he had received no compensation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. <i>As respected Prentiss Dow.</i> It appeared that <i>thirteen</i> bonds had been received by him, and that for these he paid the company at the time but $11,400 in cash, stock, and <i>other bonds</i>, the value of which was not so entirely evident. However, he was afterwards engaged in the company's service as its agent, settling claims against the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without going into more particulars, it seemed that at the time these bonds were issued, and afterwards, the La Crosse and Milwaukie Company were a good deal pressed for money, as it remained all along. Before issuing the bonds now in question, it had printed and circulated a letter essentially as follows; and the bonds, when made, were sold pretty generally, it rather appeared, for what they would bring; and that what they would bring was sometimes not much. The transactions, so far as the reporter could understand the immense body of testimony, had a good deal the aspect which generally marks the fiscal arrangements of unfinished and embarrassed railroad companies endeavoring to get themselves into successful operation. While resorts to equivocal expedients might have been sometimes practised, many of the witnesses spoke without personal knowledge, and from impressions chiefly. The circular was thus:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'OFFICE OF THE LA CROSSE</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AND MILWAUKIE RAILROAD CO.,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">August 10, 1857.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The importance of completing our road this season to the junction of the Western Division, sixty-one miles from Portage City, by which we should not only control the coming winter's travel of the Upper Mississippi, but receive over 300,000 acres of our land grant, has decided the board of directors to place before the stock and bondholders extraordinary inducements to furnish the means necessary to accomplish this object. The sum required to meet the engagements of the company, and finish the road sixty-one miles beyond Portage City, is about $400,000. To obtain this sum, the company now offers to the holders of its stock and unsecured bonds (now so much depreciated in market) a new issue of the million of eight per cent. bonds, payable in 1870, secured by a deed of trust to Hon. Greene C. Bronson, and J. T. Souter, President of the Bank of the Republic, in New York, upon the Eastern Division of its road from Milwaukie to Portage City, ninety-five miles, subject to a prior lien of about $13,000 per mile.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'It was intended to issue this new loan exclusively to stockholders, receiving in payment $400 in the stock of this company, and $400 in cash for a bond of $1000, but it has been concluded to extend a like privilege to bondholders of the <i>unsecured</i> bonds of this company which are outstanding, receiving such bonds, with unpaid coupons flat, upon the same terms as the stock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The subscription will be paid as follows: one-fourth of the cash payment at the time of making the subscription; the remainder, with the stock or old bonds, to be surrendered either at the time of subscribing, or on the first day of September, when the new bonds will bear date and be ready for delivery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Books are now open at this office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'BYRON KILBOURN,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'President.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6. <i>As to the charge of collusion of the complainants with Chamberlain in the proceedings to foreclose the mortgage</i>. This allegation was founded upon an agreement entered into with Chamberlain, on the 13th of November, 1859. At the time of this agreement he was in possession of the road and in the receipt of its earnings, and, for the purpose of giving to the trustees the control of its earnings during the proceedings to foreclose, he agreed to deposit them with the agent of the trustees, from day to day; and the trustees, on their part, <i>agreed</i> to appropriate them to the objects and uses provided for in the lease, as the exigencies and working of the road might require. The trustees, in order to secure the control of the agents of Chamberlain, connected with the earnings of the road and the receipts of its revenues, stipulated for a supervision over them, and for the discharge of any of them from the service if desired. They provided, also, for access to the books and papers relative to the revenues, &amp;c., of the road; also, for the appointment of a receiver in case of the non-fulfilment of the agreement on the part of Chamberlain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The interest on the second mortgage bonds, then due on them, amounted to $40,000. It was now agreed, that the proceedings of foreclosure should be conducted amicably; that no considerable opposition should be made to them by Chamberlain; and, also, that the sale should be made, if practicable, subject to the lease to Chamberlain, and that no opposition should be made to his purchase of the road at the sale under the foreclosure; but the trustees reserved the right to bid at the sale for the protection of the bondholders. The trustees also agreed, that in case Chamberlain should become the purchaser, they would extend a credit of nine, and twenty-four months upon so much of the interest as had become due.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the 3d of September, 1860, Fleming exhibited in the District Court, in this cause, a CROSS-BILL in the name of the Milwaukie and Minnesota Railroad Company, against the complainants, for discovery in support of the answer filed by him in the name of the company; and, on the same day, the court made an order on the cross-bill, that a subpoena should issue, and service be made on the solicitor of the defendants. Subpoena was issued accordingly. On the same day the court ordered that the said Bronson and Souter, defendants aforesaid, 'do enter their appearance in this suit in the clerk's office, on or before the day and time at which this subpoena is returnable, as aforesaid; otherwise, the bill filed must be taken as confessed.' The defendants to the cross-bill moved the court to strike it from the files, for the reason that it had been filed without leave of the court, and, also, subject to this motion to strike off, filed a demurrer to it. The court subsequently made an order sustaining the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cause was finally heard below, and decree passed in favor of the complainants, for FIFTY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR of the amount, principal and interest, specified in the bond secured by their mortgage to the complainants, and directing a sale of the railroad between Milwaukie and Portage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The road was at this time in the hands of a receiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal here, the following were the principal points:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. As to the answers of the two stockholders, Rockwell and Fleming, and of Fleming more particularly:&#8212;How far these answers of individual stockholders were to be regarded as answers of the Milwaukie and Minnesota Company?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Whether the cross-bill of Fleming had been properly dismissed? no leave having been asked to file it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. As respected the judgments of Sebre Howard and of Graham and Scott:&#8212;Whether they were liens?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. The real nature and effect of the transactions with the parties: 1. Chamberlain [his bonds]; 2. S. R. Foster; 3. J. T. Souter; 4. Greene C. Bronson; 5. Prentiss Dow; 6. Chamberlain [his lease, &amp;c.].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. Whether, on the whole case, and in view of the express terms of the third mortgage, that its bonds, &amp;c., were to be subject to the prior, or second mortgage, the complainants were entitled to have no more than fifty cents, as decreed them in the court below, on the dollar, or to have the full amount which the bonds on their faces called for.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Mr. Carpenter, for the defendants:</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. An issue was formed upon the record, between the complainants and the Milwaukie and Minnesota Railroad Company, by their filing a replication to its answer; and the complainants are now estopped from insisting that the <i>company</i> has not made defence. It is merely a question between the company and its stockholders, Fleming and Rockwell; and as the company did not in court object to the individual answer, but, on the contrary, retained counsel in this court to insist upon it, the company must be deemed to have ratified the act of its stockholders, and thereby to have recognized and ratified the answer so made in its name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. No leave was necessary to file the cross-bill. The leave which was granted to file the answer carried with it the leave to sustain the answer by testimony; and the cross-bill was a legitimate and proper method of obtaining such testimony. If leave were necessary, the order of the court upon the cross-bill, directing subpoena to issue, and ordering the defendants therein to appear and answer, was equivalent to leave.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. As respects the judgments of Sebre Howard and of Graham and Scott. There appears to be some confusion or misapprehension of dates. As we understand them, the judgments were liens. The existence of judgments cannot be really doubted. The mention of them by the master in his <i>list of judgments</i> should be enough in the absence of counter-testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. The testimony, as we understand it, goes to show that these transactions with Chamberlain, Foster, Souter, Bronson, and Dow, were very irregular; that the parties were not <i>bon a fide</i> holders for full value at all. The bonds were procured by the relations of confidence and control in which the parties stood to the road, by breaches of trust and confidence, implied, if not direct. Certainly, there were many of them got at enormous discounts. This sort of operation is a crying evil of our country. Men placed to manage corporations for the interest of the stockholders, manage them only for their own. They become contractor, half ruin the corporation, pay themselves with its assets at enormous discounts, then resuscitate things and are rich in the result. Here Chamberlain, confessedly, paid but fifty per cent. for his large amount. As to Souter, he was a trustee; a party who ought not to have dealt in these bonds at all. Guest, under whose act he claims, was vice-president, no doubt; but this gave him no authority to make the transactions with Souter which he did. Bronson's claim is worse; he was a trustee and a stockholder both; stockholder in an insolvent corporation. He sold, or pretended to sell, his stock to the company for $15,000; bonds secured by mortgage on its property. This was a fraud upon its creditors. The assets of a corporation constitute a fund for the payment of its debts. 'If they are held by the corporation itself, and so invested as to be subject to legal process, they may be levied on by such process. <i>If they have been distributed among stockholders</i>, or gone into the hands of other than <i>bon a fide</i> creditors or purchasers, leaving debts of the corporation unpaid, <i>such holders take the property charged with the trust in favor of creditors</i>, which a court of equity will enforce, and compel the application of the property to the satisfaction of their debts.'<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Bronson was transformed by the operation which he effected, and which we object to, from the condition of one of the corporators of an insolvent corporation to that of its preferred creditor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. How does the notice on the back of the third mortgage affect the case? Even though the organization of the Milwaukie and Minnesota Company arose under a junior mortgage, it still claims with the rights of both a purchaser and a creditor, for it advanced its money on a specific lien.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Such a party may always set aside a fraudulent conveyance, even though when about to lend his money such conveyance may have been flouted in his face to prevent his doing so. These trustees nowhere assert that they hold for <i>full value</i>, or that any one under them does, though they state that the bonds were signed, registered, issued, and negotiated. Every one in Wisconsin knows that no full value was given. The term 'Corruption Bonds' was not more the stigma of a fraud than an illustration of the natural tendency of language to assert proper nomenclature from new facts. The circular issued August 10th, 1857, shows the circumstances under which parties were invited to buy these bonds. They were invited to irregular transactions; and the sequel showed that they profited well of their bidding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6. The lease to Chamberlain was a part of the general style of management; and if the final arrangements by which the attempt to foreclose the second mortgage were facilitated are conceived of by the court as we conceive them, it will have no difficulty in simply affirming the decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Messrs. Carlisle and J. S. Brown, contra:</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The answers by Fleming and Rockwell were not an appearance of the <i>company</i>, or answer of the <i>company</i>, in fact. The company was a distinct, political, or legal person, which could sue Mr. Fleming or Mr. Rockwell, or be sued by them. A corporation must appear by its authorized attorney, and its answer must be under seal, authenticated and attached by the proper officers. The law intrusted the management of its affairs to a board of directors, and in the eye of the law, and for purposes of this suit, they alone represent the company. It was for that board to determine whether any defence, and what defence, was expedient, and whether they would file an answer admitting our rights, or by silence give an admission in the law. That board of directors chose the latter mode, and upon that fact the court below gave us an order, <i>pro confesso</i>, against it. Its position as defendant to a foreclosure suit gave the court below no power to take the management of the suit from the directors (or, in other words, from the defendant interested) and give it to a man who, although stockholder, was in the law a stranger. It certainly gave no power so to do on a petition, without notice to the directors interested in the result. If they had abused their powers, or misrepresented the interests of the company in such a manner as to justify a decree of ouster, that should have been obtained by decree of a State court having jurisdiction over such matter, upon proper proceeding, for that identical purpose; and then the management of the company affairs and of its defence would be in such new hands as the law intrusted them to, and not in a mere volunteer for the purpose of litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The fact that the cross-bill was irregularly filed we think to be clear by the settled rules of chancery. The court below, itself, set it aside, though decreeing generally so much against us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. To entitle Graham and Sebre Howard to defend against the mortgage as a fraud upon creditors, it was necessary for them to set up in their answers, and to <i>prove</i> their relations as creditors at the <i>time</i> of the mortgage; a <i>subsequent</i> relation of creditors does not enable them to inquire into these frauds. No evidence of judgments is before the court but the list attached to the master's report, and this does not prove their dates or their existence. Courts do not allow litigation of abstract principles; and a party who complains of fraud must show that he can gain or lose by by the decision of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their answers, Graham and Scott allege a judgment in the Circuit Court of Milwaukie County in September, 1858, and a judgment in the United States District Court in 1859, both of which were <i>subsequent</i> to the third mortgage. Howard alleges a judgment in the Circuit Court of the County of Milwaukie in May, and a subsequent judgment in the United States District Court in 1859, for the same cause of action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. The making of the mortgage and the issuing of the bonds is confessed. Now how stand the individual cases which make the most defined cause of defence?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>As to Chamberlain</i>. The two hundred bonds issued to him depend upon the power of directors in good faith to agree with a contractor upon the amount of damages done to him for breach of contract. Chamberlain had a just claim, and they pay him in bonds at their market rate. What objection is there to this, even if the rate is but fifty per cent.?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>As to Foster</i>. These one hundred bonds were sold in the regular course of business; and the directors afterwards, on settlement, allowed Mr. Foster an additional amount in landgrant bonds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>As to J. T. Souter</i>. These fifty-five bonds were given in exchange for other bonds of the company, for which the receipt of the vice-president is produced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>As to G. C. Bronson</i>. The fifteen bonds of Bronson were delivered to him in exchange for stock purchased by him of the company, under an express agreement that they would repurchase at the same price,&#8212;eighty cents on the dollar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>As to Prentiss Dow</i>. These bonds, fifteen only, were purchased and paid for by him in the regular course of business, and are long since sold.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Six hundred and fifteen bonds stand unimpeached by any legitimate testimony. The answer deals, indeed, in general allegations. It alleges that so many bonds were sold to various persons, for which, in the aggregate, only a certain sum was received in money, and the balance (of eighty cents on the dollar) in 'Barstow Bonds,' or 'Corruption Bonds,' or in stock. But what 'Corruption Bonds' were, or 'Barstow Bonds' are, we are not told. So we are uninformed as to what proportion was paid in money, what in stock, what in these bonds; nor does the answer distinguish between the different transactions. Indeed, only this kind of general allegation marks even those cases where specific charges are pretended to be set up. The charge as to the transaction with Foster merely alleges in general terms that the La Crosse Company was overreached. That as to Dow is in the same position. That as to Souter is a little more distinct in its charge of fraud on the La Crosse Company, but, like the rest, fails to state what bonds were so obtained. The charge as to Chamberlain is a general one, that in some way, under pretence of settling a claim for damages, he obtained a larger sum than should have been allowed him. The charge that directors made the mortgage in fraud of creditors is the one in which allegations are the most specific; but even with these no debts are stated, no creditors given, nor is it charged that any one of the holders of bonds was aware of the condition of the company, or of the fraudulent intentions of the directors. No combination is anywhere charged. Now, in all the cases specified, and in the remainder not specified, we insist upon this rule, to wit, that when an answer seeks to attack bonds issued by a railroad company to various parties, by various transactions, and to set aside such bonds as fraudulent, it must, in regard to each transaction, contain all the allegations which would be necessary in an original bill against the holder to set aside such bonds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. The fact that the third mortgage was made subject in terms to the payment of the Bronson and Souter bonds in full, is ingeniously evaded by Mr. Carpenter. It is not met and answered. What equity have these junior mortgagees with such a fact in the case? Admit that the bonds were sold below par, or given away for nothing, still, had not the <i>stockholders</i>, when asking a new loan, a right to ratify them as against these parties? to say to parties proposing to lend, 'We shall be happy to deal with you, but you must recognize <i>in full</i> the existing bonds. <i>Observe the conditions?</i>' That is what they did say. And subject to what was said the lenders lent: lending at higher rates in proportion as their security was impaired by its stipulated inferiority to the preceding debt. If the case were between original <i>stockholders</i>, denying the acts of the directors of the road, and the holders of the second mortgage bonds, an equity might exist. But the case is not that one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6. Finally, it is to be remembered, that at the time when these bonds were negotiated, the whole Northwest, and especially Wisconsin, was under a cloud, and railroad property was of doubtful value. The division of the road in question was then subject to a mortgage of $13,000 on every mile. Interest was in arrears; and if the earnings of the road pending litigation on our mortage were not faithfully applied to keep down interest on prior incumbrances, those prior incumbrances might be foreclosed, and sweep the entire property from under our mortgage. This, indeed, we may say, in passing, was the secret of the agreement in the lease to Chamberlain. Thirteen hundred thousand dollars in those days could not easily be raised for investment in Western securities. The circular of 17th of August, adumbrates, or rather projects, in broad cast, the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We submit that in such a case, indeed, that in most cases the negotiation and sale of railroad bonds do not stand upon the same footing as ordinary transactions between individuals. Whatever may be the opinion of any one as to the expediency of such a policy, the custom of the country has established a mode of dealing in such securities peculiar to itself. These bonds are universally sold in the market for what they will bring. They are not founded upon, nor do they presuppose a previous indebtedness to support them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Independently of this, it is too late for any corporation, municipal, railroad, or other, to issue bonds, to sell or negotiate them in ordinary transactions, and then come into <i>this</i> court, with a hope of getting clear of any portion of the payment of them. Repudiation, in whatever garb or guise it has presented itself, within these precincts, and in <i>this</i> purprise, has been invariably sent away; driven out with peremptory orders never, in any form, to appear again. Such doctrines as have been asserted in some of our legislatures, and tolerated even in certain courts of the States, have been frowned on as dishonoring the law, and dishonoring the land.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> If, in particular cases, they have worked hardship to particular persons, or in particular regions, they will do infinite service to the country in that they keep in full life the sense of obligation which should ever attend the creation of debt, and that they maintain, in its proudest elevation, that honorable justice which is the standing interest of all countries and of all times.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice NELSON delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the two stockholders (Rockwell and Fleming), though not made defendants by the bill, were permitted, by leave of the court, to appear and put in answers in the name of the Milwaukie and Minnesota Company, it is material to inquire into the effect to be given to them. That they cannot be regarded as the answers of the corporate body is manifest, as a corporation must appear and answer to the bill, not under oath, but under its common seal. And an omission thus to appear and answer according to the rules and practice of the court, entitle the complainants to enter an order that the bill be taken <i>pro confesso</i>. A further objection to the practice of permitting a party to appear and answer in the name of the corporation is the inequality that would exist between the parties to the litigation. The corporation not being before the court, it would not be bound by any order or decree rendered against it, nor by any admissions made in the answer or stipulations that might be entered into by the parties or their counsel. It is thus apparent, that while the name of the corporation is thus used as a real party in the litigation so far as the rights and interests of the complainants are concerned, it is an unreal and fictitious party so far as respects any obligaion or responsibility on the part of the respondents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is insisted, however, that the directors of this company refused to appear and defend the bill filed against them, and for the fraudulent purpose of sacrificing the interests of the stockholders; and, hence, the necessity, as well as the propriety and justice, of permitting the defence by a stockholder in their name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Undoubtedly, in the case supposed, it would be a reproach to the law, and especially in a court of equity, if the stockholders were remediless. But in such a case, the court in its discretion will permit a stockholder to become a party defendant, for the purpose of protecting his own interests against unfounded or illegal claims against the company; and he will also be permitted to appear on behalf of other stockholders who may desire to join him in the defence. But this defence is independent of the company and of its directors, and the stockholder becomes a real and substantial party to the extent of his own interests and of those who may join him, and against whom any proceeding, order, or decree of the court in the cause is binding, and may be enforced. It is true, the remedy is an extreme one, and should be admitted by the court with hesitation and caution; but it grows out of the necessity of the case and for the sake of justice, and may be the only remedy to prevent of flagrant wrong. A complainant, if he chooses, may compel a corporation to appear and answer by a writ of <i>distringas;</i> or be may join with the corporation, a director, or officer, if he desires a discovery under oath. But we are not aware of any other except a complainant who can compel and appearance or answer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, although the appearance and answers of the stockholders (Rockwell and Fleming) were irregularly allowed by the court, as each was permitted to appear and answer in the name of the company, yet, as the defence set up is doubtless the same as that which they would have relied on if they had been admitted simply as stockholders, we are inclined to regard the answers the same as if put in by them in that character, in the further views we shall take of the case. Each one swore to the truth of his answer in the usual way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before we enter upon an examination of the merits of the case, it will be proper to dispose of the CROSS-BILL filed by Fleming against the complainants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This bill was filed in the name of the company alone, signed by their solicitors and counsel. The name of Fleming does not appear. And in addition to this, it appears that Fleming, in his petition for leave to appear and answer the bill in the name of the company, also asked leave to file a cross-bill. Leave was granted to put in the answer, but not to file the bill. The filing of it subsequently, therefore, was an irregularity for which the court below very properly afterwards set it aside. The cross-bill, so much spoken of in the argument, is thus out of the case. In this connection we may as well refer to the answers of the judgment creditors, who were made parties defendant to the bill of complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sebre Howard recovered a judgment in the United States District Court, on the 28th November, 1859, against the La Crosse and Milwaukie Railroad Company, for the sum of $16,379.86; and Graham &amp; Scott, a judgment in a State court of Wisconsion, on the 25th November, 1858, against the same company for the sum of $29,820.71; and another judgment in the same court, on the 21st September, 1858, for the sum of $11,188.15; and also a judgment against the same company, in the United States District Court, on the 11th January, 1860, for the sum of $44,413.18. This latter judgment appears from the answer, as we understand it, to have been founded on the two previous judgments in the State court. Now, it appears that each of these judgments were recovered after the date of the third mortgage of the La Crosse and Milwaukie Company, upon the foreclosure of which the Milwaukie and Minnesota Company was formed. The liens of these judgments were subsequent to this mortgage, and were cut off by its foreclosure. Indeed, the judgment of Howard, of November, 1858, and the last judgment of Graham &amp; Scott, which was recovered in 1860, never were liens upon any interest in the road of the La Crosse and Milwaukie Company, the defendants in the judgments, as the equity of redemption had already passed to the purchaser under the sale to Barnes in the foreclosure of the third mortgage, and afterwards became vested in the Milwaukie and Minnesota Company. These judgment creditors, therefore, according to their answers, have no interest in the subject-matter of this litigation. We may add, that as replications were filed to the answers, the proof of these judgments should have been produced at the hearing. But the only proof of them that we have found in the record, is in a list of judgments annexed to the report of the master. They were material, and were put in issue by the replication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These answers of the judgment creditors being thus disposed of, the issues in the case are brought down to those raised by the answers of Rockwell and Fleming, in the name of the Milwaukie and Minnesota Company, which we have agreed to consider rather by indulgence than as matter of strict right, as the answers of the individual stockholders. And this brings us to an examination of what may be called the merits of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before we take up the questions presented by these answers to the bill which bear upon the merits, it will be proper to refer to some matters there presented, and very much discussed on the argument, which, in our judgment, should be laid entirely out of the case, as tending only to confuse and embarrass the real questions involved. We refer to those parts of the answers which relate to the dealings between the La Crosse and Milwaukie Company and Chamberlain, in which the complainants in this suit were not concerned, and with which they had no connection, as, for instance, the lease of the road to Chamberlain, and the allegation of fraud against him and against the company in conducting the business of running the road under this lease. Also, in respect to other contracts between these parties in relation to the indebtedness of the company to Chamberlain, and to the building and completion of unfinished portions of the road, and equipping it with the rolling stock for use. These relate to the dealings of the mortgagor, the La Crosse and Milwaukie Company, with a third person, over which the complainants, as mortgagees, had no control, and for which they were not responsible. These dealings were subsequent to the execution and lien of the mortgage, and could not affect prejudicially the rights of the mortgagees. They had no interest in the earnings of the road, or concern in the appropriation of them, until the filing of the bill and the appointment of a receiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only matters, therefore, set forth in these answers, and in the proofs, which have any bearing on the merits, are:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The allegation that Chamberlain received from the La Crosse and Milwaukie Company two hundred of the bonds secured by this mortgage fraudulently and without consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. That S. R. Foster received one hundred of the bonds in the same way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. That J. T. Soutter, one of the trustees, received fifty-five of them, and refused to deliver them to the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. That Greene C. Bronson, the other trustee, received fifteen for the stock of the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. That Prentiss Dow, an officer of the company, received fourteen for less than one thousand dollars.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And 6. That Chamberlain, who had covenanted, in the lease of the road from the company, to apply the proceeds derived from the use of it to the payment of the interest accruing on the bonds, withheld the payment in pursuance of a fraudulent arrangement with the trustees, or with their agents, for the purpose of bringing about a foreclosure of the mortgage, that he might be enabled to purchase the road.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These are the allegations that bear upon the merits of the controversy, and deserve to be considered. We shall not, however, encumber this opinion with any very detailed explanation of them, but shall briefly refer to the proofs relating to each of these charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>As to Chamberlain</i>. It appears that he held a large claim for damages against the company, on account of their failure to fulfil contracts made with him to build the Western Division of the road. The work on the road was suspended by reason of this failure. And in the fall of 1857, upon the issue of the bonds of the company, under this second mortgage, an arrangement was entered into by the company, by which he received these two hundred bonds, at fifty cents on the dollar, towards payment of this claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>As to S. R. Foster</i>. He had loaned the company over one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, and had taken their bonds as security, and, among others, the one hundred in question. It appears that, at a meeting of the Board of Directors, 24th May, 1858, the matter between them was adjusted by delivery of forty land-grant bonds to Foster.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>As to T. J. Soutter</i>. The fifty-five bonds in controversy between him and the company were settled, as appears by a receipt of their chairman and vice-president, on 14th September, 1858, by the delivery of other bonds to the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. <i>As to G. C. Bronson</i>. He had purchased fifteen thousand dollars of stock, one hundred and fifty shares, from the company, in the spring of 1857, and paid eighty cents cash on the dollar, the president at the time agreeing that the company would repurchase it at the same rate, at any time thereafter, if he should wish to surrender it back. The company was, doubtless, pressed for money at the time. At a meeting of the Board of Directors, on the 2d of September, 1858, it was resolved, that it would take into consideration the stock theretofore purchased by Judge Bronson, as he rendered many services to the company for which he had received no compensation; and afterwards, in September of the same year, it appears that the president of the company, who had induced him to purchase the stock, received it back, and delivered to him the fifteen bonds in question. The truth of the case, therefore, is, that instead of receiving from the company the money he had advanced for the stock, according to their agreement, he received in place of it only bonds of the company of less than half the value; and, as it appears, nothing for his legal advice and services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. <i>As to Prentiss Dow</i>. It appears that but thirteen bonds had been received by him, and for which he paid the company, at the time, $11,400 in cash, stock, and other bons, and was afterwards engaged in its service as agent, settling claims against the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this connection, it is proper to refer to the terms, as published in a circular by the La Crosse and Milwaukie Company, and under which these bonds were negotiated and put into circulation. This paper is dated August 10th, 1857. The company state, that the importance of completing the road this season to the junction of the Western Division (sixty miles from Portage), by which they would not only control the coming winter's travel of the Upper Mississippi, but receive over 300,000 acres of the land grants, have determined the Board of Directors to place before the stock and bondholders extraordinary inducements to furnish the means; that the sum of $400,000 would be required. To obtain this sum, the company now offers the holders of its stock and of unsecured bonds, a new issue of one million of 8 per cent. bonds, &amp;c. The terms proposed are, to receive in payment for a bond of $1000, $400 in cash, and the like sum in the stock or unsecured bonds of the company. It was upon these terms that the directors went into the market, in the city of New York and elsewhere, for the purpose of negotiating the bonds which now constitute the subject of litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6. <i>As to the charge of collusion of the complainants with Chamberlain, in the proceedings to foreclose the mortgage</i>. This allegation is founded upon an agreement entered into with Chamberlain, on the 13th of November, 1859. At the time of this agreement he was in possession of the road, and in the receipt of its earnings, and the obvious object of it, on the part of the trustees, was to procure the control of the net proceeds of its earnings, pending the proceedings of foreclosure. For this purpose, Chamberlain agreed to deposit the whole of the earnings with the agent of the trustees, from day to day; and the trustees, on their part, agreed to appropriate them to the objects and uses provided for in the lease, as the exigencies and proper working of the road might require. The trustees, in order to secure the fidelity of the officers and agents of Chamberlain, connected with the earnings of the road and the receipt of its revenues, stipulated for a supervision and control over these persons, and for the discharge of any of them from the service, in case of a dereliction of duty. They provided, also, for access to the books and papers relating to the revenues, management, and running of the road; also, for the appointment of a receiver, in case of the non-fulfilment of the agreement on the part of Chamberlain. These provisions were very important, as the revenues of the road, according to the terms of the lease, after covering running expenses and paying the interest on prior incumbrances, were to be applied to the discharge of the interest on these second mortgage bonds. The interest then due on them amounted to $40,000. It was also agreed that the proceedings of foreclosure should be conducted amicably; that is, no unreasonable opposition should be made to them by Chamberlain. It was further agreed that the sale should be made, if practicable, subject to the lease of Chamberlain, and that no opposition should be made to his purchase of the road at the sale under the foreclosure; but the trustees expressly reserved the right to bid at the sale for the protection of the bondholders. The trustees also agreed that, in case Chamberlain should become the purchaser, they would extend a credit of nine and twenty-four months upon so much of the interest as had become due.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is supposed that the arrangement was entered into for the fraudulent purpose of enabling Chamberlain to purchase the road at the foreclosure sale, and thereby cut off subsequent incumbrances, and especially the rights and interests of the Milwaukie and Minnesota Company, formed under the third mortgage. But there is no evidence of this charge in the proofs, nor even of any previous dealings between the parties, tending to this conclusion. They came together for the first time after the trustees had determined to foreclose the mortgage for default in the payment of interest, and finding Chamberlain in the possession of the road, and refusing to deliver it over to the trustees, as provided for in the mortgage, but, on the contrary, insisting upon his right to run the same pending the legal proceedings, it is not strange that th etrustees should have endeavored to arrange with him for a supervision and control, in the meantime, over the earnings and management of the road, and that he should forbear any unreasonable opposition to the foreclosure suit. And as to the provision relating to the purchase in case of a sale, there is nothing in it interfering with any rights that belonged to the trustees, or to the prejudice of third parties, the judgment creditors, or company formed under the third mortgage. In a word, the arrangement was highly beneficial to the bondholders represented by the trustees, and prejudicial to no one concerned in the foreclosure suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We shall not, however, dwell longer on this branch of the case; indeed, much that we have thus far said has been rather by way of explanation, and for the purpose of clearing it of matters and issues that do not belong to it, and have served only to confuse and embarrass its consideration. In view of this object and purpose, we have referred to the two answers of the stockholders, Rockwell and Fleming, and have endeavored to separate the irrelevant matter from that which bore upon the merits, so as to confine the examination to the latter, namely, to the charges against the validity of the bonds impeached, of the number of some three hundred and eighty, in the hands, or which passed into the hands of several individuals named, and have shown, as we think, by a reference to the proofs, that these charges are not well founded. The general and sweeping allegations against the other portion of the bonds, without specification or identity, we have not specially noticed. These charges are too general to be entitled to consideration, and the proofs relied on are as general and indefinite as the allegations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have also shown that the judgment creditors who appeared and answered have no interest in the matters in controversy; and, lastly, that the charges of a fraudulent collusion between the trustees and Chamberlain rest upon suspicion instead of upon proofs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now come to a branch of the case which presents a more conclusive answer to all the charges, whether in allegations or in proofs of the respondents, and overrides all other views that may or can be taken of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have seen this third mortgage, under which the Milwaukie and Minnesota Company was formed, was executed and delivered to Barnes, the trustee, on the 22d June, 1858, to secure the payment of an issue of $2,000,000 in bonds, and a supplement to this mortgage was executed to the same trustee, on the 11th August following.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These two mortgages, or rather one in two parts, were, in express terms, <i>made subject, among other incumbrances mentioned, to the bonds secured by a second mortgage on the Eastern Division of the road, to the amount of one million of dollars</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, the bonds issued under this third mortgage, one of which is in the proofs, have an indorsement on the back, as follows: '<i>State of Wisconsin, La Crosse and Milwaukie Railroad Company, third mortgage sinking fund bond, seven per cent.,</i> <i>&amp;c.;</i>' subject, among other things, '<i>to a second mortgage on the same line of road of</i> $1,000,000.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time this third mortgage was executed, and thus made subject to the second mortgage bonds, all these bonds had been negotiated by the company, and were in circulation in the business community. They were all negotiated in the months of September, October, November, and December, 1857. This, the company, of course, well knew at the time of the execution of the third mortgage, and knew, also, of the circumstances attending the negotiation of them. They had received and were in the enjoyment of the avails of them, and with this knowledge, and under these circumstances, the third mortgage, and the bonds issued under it, were made in express terms subject to the payment and satisfaction of the bonds issued under the second. All persons, therefore, taking these third mortgage bonds, or coming in under the mortgage, took them and came in with a full knowledge that the mortgagor had made the security subject to the prior lien and indebtedness. Even if there had been any valid objection to these bonds under the second mortgage, it was competent for the obligor to waive them, and no better proof could be furnished of the waiver, than the acknowledgment of the full indebtedness, by making the subsequent security subject to it. This was a question that belonged to the obligor to determine for himself when giving the third mortgage; but, besides this, what right have those coming in under it to complain? They come in with full notice of the acknowledgment of the indebtedness and previous lien; and, especially, what right have the Milwaukie and Minnesota Company to complain, who purchased the equity of redemption through Barnes, their agent, subject to the previous incumbrances of $1,000,000. They have the benefit of that incumbrance by an abatement of that amount in the price of the purchase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without pursuing the case further, we are satisfied the decree of the court below, reducing the indebtedness of the La Crosse and Milwaukie Company to the bondholders, is erroneous, and that the decision should have been for the full amount of one million of dollars, and interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WE SHALL, THEREFORE, REVERSE the decree, and remit the cause to the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Wisconsin, with directions to enter a decree for all the interest due and secured by the mortgage, with costs; that the court ascertain the amount of moneys in the hands of the receiver or receivers from the earnings of the road covered by the mortgage, which may be applicable to the discharge of the interest, and apply it to the same; and that if the moneys thus applied are not sufficient to discharge the interest due on the first day of March, 1864, then to ascertain the balance remaining due at that date, and in case such balance is not paid within one year from the date of the order of the court ascertaining it, then an order shall be entered directing a sale of the mortgaged premises, under the direction of the court, and on bringing the proceeds into court, they shall be applied to the payment of the balance of interest; and if they exceed such balance, shall be applied to the future accruing interest down to the sale; and if they exceed that, to the principal of the bonds, in case the bondholders assent, or <i>pro rata</i> to those who may assent, and any remaining balance of the proceeds to be invested, under the direction of the court, for the payment of future accruing interest, and ultimately the principal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AND FURTHER, that in case the interest upon the bonds is paid without a sale, the decree shall remain as security for subsequent accruing interest, and ultimately for the principal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AND FURTHER, that the court may pay out of moneys in the hands of the receiver, or out of the proceeds, the taxed costs of the trustees in the proceedings for the foreclosure of the mortgage, not taxed and received from the defendants in those proceedings; and also such counsel fees in behalf of the trustees, as the court, in its discretion, may seem right to allow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DECREE ACCORDINGLY.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> This case was decided at the last term.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> For an understanding of the position of this road, its Eastern Division, &amp;c., see diagram, infra, p. 610.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> There seemed to be some confusion about these dates, &amp;c., not perfectly understood by the reporter.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> See 1 Wallace, p. 411, note.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Whether this decree directed also a sale of any portion of the rolling stock, was one of the questions litigated by the parties in a second appeal, reported <i>infra</i>, p. 609.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Curran <i>v.</i> State of Arkansas, 15 Howard, 307.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Finch <i>v.</i> Earl of Winchelsea, 1 Peere Williams, 278.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> See Mercer County <i>v.</i> Hacket, 1 Wallace, 83; Gelpcke <i>v.</i> City of Dubuque, Id. 175, REP.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
