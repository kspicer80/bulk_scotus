And the said judges being so opposed in opinion upon the question aforesaid, the same was, then and there, at the request of the district-attorney for the United States, stated, under the direction of the judges, and ordered by the court to be certified, under the seal of the court, to the supreme court, at their next session to be held thereafter, to be finally decided by the said supreme court; and the court being further of opinion, that further proceedings could not be had in said cause, without prejudice to the merits of the same cause, did order that the jury impannelled as aforesaid to try said cause, be discharged from giving any verdict therein.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was presented to the consideration of the court, by <i>Taney</i> Attorney-General.
