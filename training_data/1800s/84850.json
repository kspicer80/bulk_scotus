M. Viers and Patsy his wife, late Patsy Henly, to compel the latter to convey to the former the legal estate in certain lands in Kentucky, which one Ebenezer Brooks, since deceased, conveyed, by deeds dated the 10th of November, 1791, to the defendant's wife, while a widow, and which Brooks by his last will devised to the complainant Montgomery. The bill charged that the only consideration of the deeds from Brooks to Patsy Henly was, that she should 'take him as her husband,' which she refused to do, but intermarried with the defendant, W. M. Viers. It did not aver that the complainant was of kin to the deceased, or that he had any equitable claim other than as a devisee. Nor did it charge the defendant Patsy with any promise of marriage, or any breach of such a promise, nor with fraud in obtaining the deeds. The will of Brooks, referred to in the bill, calls the complainant his friend and <i>cousin</i>. The deeds were of bargain and sale in fee, and purported to be in consideration of 1,100<i>l.</i> Virginia currency, and contained a warranty against Brooks, and all claiming under him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The answer of the defendants denied that the consideration of the deeds was as stated in the bill, and avers that the defendant Patsy, although solicited, always refused to make any promise of marriage to the deceased; that he often pressed her to accept his land, which she for some time declined; that he declared he did not expect any consideration, but wished her to receive it as a gift, and that he did not expect she would marry him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It alleged that Brooks had boarded in her house some months, where he had been kindly and hospitably treated, without any charge being made against him, and suggested that this, together with the affection which he entertained for her, but which she always discountenanced, were his motives for giving her the land.
