In <i>Ralls County</i> v. <i>Douglass,</i> 105 U.S. 728, the cases in the Supreme Court of the State and in this court bearing on that question are referred to, and our conclusion distinctly stated.

It is an admitted fact in this case that McKenzie, the defendant in error, is a <i>bona fide holder</i> for value of the coupons sued on, and the recitals, which are almost in the exact language of those in <i>Wilson</i> v. <i>Salamanca, supra</i><i>,</i> imply authority for the issue of the bonds from which they were cut.

The last order was made at a regular term. Under these circumstances, it is certainly to be presumed, in the absence of anything to the contrary, that the terms were regularly called and held. It was, therefore, not error to admit the records in evidence without proof of the order for the adjourned term, or the call for the special term. The fact that the order of the 7th of August, 1871, is referred to in the recitals of the bond as having been made on the 12th, is unimportant. <i>Smith</i> v. <i>County of Clark,</i> 54 Mo. 58.</p>\n<p><i>The judgment is affirmed.</i></p>\n</div>",
