The original suit, in which the judgment was obtained, was commenced by a process of foreign attachment, according to the local laws of Massachusetts; but the defendant, Mayhew, subsequently appeared and took defence. The cause was referred to arbitrators, and judgment rendered upon their report against the defendant, Mayhew, for the sum of $4,788 57 debt, and $284 33 cents costs. The defendants in error having declared upon this judgment against the plaintiff in the District Court of Louisiana, the plaintiff in error pleaded <i>nil debet</i>, to which plea there was a general demurrer, and judgment being rendered thereon for the defendants in error, for the sum of 5,072 dollars and 90 cents debt, with interest thereon, &amp;c. and the cause was brought before this Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\"><i>Feb.</i> 10<i>th.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This cause was argued by Mr. <i>C.
