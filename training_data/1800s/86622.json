JOHN, CLAIMANT OF THE STEAMBOAT NEPTUNE, APPELLANT,<br>\nv.<br>\nZEBULON A. PAINE, SARAH NORWOOD, JOHN BUCKNAM, ANDREW BRADFORD, AND AUGUSTUS NORTON, LIBELLANTS.</h1></center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center></center>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*574</span> It was argued by Mr. Wood, for the appellant, and Mr. Gillet, for the appellees.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*579</span> Mr. Justice NELSON delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>This is an appeal from a decree of the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York.</p>\n<p>The suit was commenced in the District Court in admiralty against the steamboat Neptune by the appellees, who were the owners of the schooner Iole, for damages done by a collision on Long Island Sound, off Stratford Point, on the evening of the 14th of July, 1846.</p>\n<p>The Iole was laden with a cargo of lumber, plaster, and fish in barrels, and was of about eighty tons burden</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*580</span> The Neptune had on board from 200 to 250 passengers. The schooner was struck near midships, on the larboard side, and immediately sunk, carrying with her a woman and child, who were lost.</p>\n<p>The libel charges that the schooner was on her voyage up the Sound to New York; and that about a mile south of the light-boat stationed off the Middle Ground, a shoal at that place, and nearly opposite Stratford Point, some sixty miles from New York, she was steering about a west course, the wind being from the north, and the night clear, so that a vessel could be descried at a considerable distance; and that while sailing upon this course with a fresh wind, going at from six to eight knots an hour, and a short time after the schooner had passed the light-boat, between the hours of nine and ten o'clock at night, she was negligently run down by the Neptune, which vessel was proceeding down the Sound from New York, and struck against her hull, head on, between the fore and main rigging on the larboard side, with such force and violence as to break open her hull, and cut her nearly in two, so that she filled and sunk immediately.</p>\n<p>The allegations of the answer are, that the Neptune had sailed from New York at five o'clock of the afternoon of that day, bound for Newport and Providence (R.I.), and had proceeded on her voyage until within about a mile from Stratford light-boat, when, at or about eight or ten o'clock in the evening, a vessel was descried about a quarter of a mile ahead, which turned out to be the Iole in question. That immediately on seeing the vessel, the course of the Neptune was changed to windward for the purpose of giving her the course she was running. That when the Neptune was about ten or twelve lengths from the schooner, it was seen that she had changed her course, and was luffing up into the wind so as to cross the bows of the steamboat. That when first seen, the Iole was running west by south, from which she changed suddenly to about northwest; that, on seeing she had changed her course, the bell of the Neptune was immediately rung to stop her, and all efforts made to avoid the collision; but that the schooner came directly across the bows of the steamboat, and, the latter having still some headway, a collision could not be avoided.</p>\n<p>It will be seen from these allegations of the respective parties, that the issue between them, and upon which the case must turn in favor of the one or the other, is a very simple one, whether we have regard to the law or to the facts.</p>\n<p>The statement of the Iole is, that she was proceeding on a west course up the Sound, nearly close-hauled to the wind, with her starboard tacks on board, at the rate of about seven knots <span class=\"star-pagination\">*581</span> an hour; and that, while keeping on this course, the Neptune, in an improper man\u009cuvre to cross her trail, and pass to the windward, struck her near midships on the larboard side, and sunk her.</p>\n<p>The allegation of the Neptune does not vary substantially from this statement, except that it charges the collision to the fault of the Iole in not keeping on her course, but suddenly changing it by throwing her head into the wind, and thereby placing her athwart the track of the steamboat as she was in the act of passing to the windward.</p>\n<p>The general question involved in the case is, which of these vessels has been in fault; and this will depend upon the evidence produced by each in the court below, together with the application of the rules of navigation to be observed by them at the time of the collision, and with a view to avoid it, having regard to their relative position and course; and, more especially, the application of these rules under the facts and circumstances, in a case where the colliding vessel is propelled by steam, and the other by sails.</p>\n<p>Among the nautical rules applicable to the navigation of sailing vessels are the following, viz.: \u0097 A vessel that has the wind free, or sailing before or with the wind, must get out of the way of the vessel that is close-hauled, or sailing by or against it; and the vessel on the starboard tack has a right to keep her course, and the one on the larboard tack must give way, or be answerable for the consequences. So, when two vessels are approaching each other, both having the wind free, and consequently the power of readily controlling their movements, the vessel on the larboard tack must give way, and each pass to the right. The same rule governs vessels sailing on the wind and approaching each other, when it is doubtful which is to windward. But if the vessel on the larboard tack is so far to windward that, if both persist in their course, the other will strike her on the lee side abaft the beam or near the stern, in that case the vessel on the starboard tack should give way, as she can do so with greater facility and less loss of time and distance than the other. Again, when vessels are crossing each other in opposite directions, and there is the least doubt of their going clear, the vessel on the starboard tack should persevere in her course, while that on the larboard tack should bear up, or keep away before the wind. The Friends, 1 Wm. Rob. 483; The Traveller, 2 Wm. Rob. 197; The Ann and Mary, Ib. 189; The Chester, 3 Hagg. 316; The Jupiter, Ib. 320; The Celt, Ib. 327; The Woodrop Sims, 2 Dodson, 86; The Thames, 5 Rob. 345; 3 Carr. &amp;. Payne, 528; 9 Ib. 601; 12 Moore, 148; 3 Kent, Com. 230.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*582</span> These rules have their exceptions in extreme cases, depending upon the special circumstances of the case, and in respect to which no general rule can be laid down or applied. Either vessel may find herself in a position at the time when it would be impossible to conform to them without certain peril to herself, or a collision with the approaching vessel. Under such circumstances, the master must necessarily be thrown upon the resources of his own judgment and skill in extricating his own vessel, as well as the vessel approaching, from the impending peril. These cases cannot be anticipated, and therefore cannot be provided for by any fixed regulation. They can only be examined, and the management of the vessel approved or condemned, as the case may arise.</p>\n<p>But no one can look through the reports in admiralty in England without being struck with the steadiness and rigor with which these general nautical rules have been enforced in cases of collision, under the advice of the Trinity masters of that court, or fail to be impressed with the justice and propriety of such application, and the salutary results flowing from it.</p>\n<p>In the case of the Traveller, an exception was set up by the colliding vessel, on the ground that the other, when first described, was about two points on her lee bow. This was denied. But the court declined to enter into a minute examination as to which of the statements was correct, observing that it had been distinctly laid down, over and over again, that when two vessels on opposite tacks are approaching each other, and there is a probability of collision, it is the duty of the vessel on the larboard to give way at once, without considering whether the other vessel be one or more points to leeward. And, in the case of the Friends, the court, where an exception was attempted to be ungrafted on the Trinity rules, in submitting the case to the Trinity masters, recommended that, for the sake of the safe navigation of the Thames and the great interests which are daily and hourly there at stake, the exception, if any were to be made, should be clear, definite, and intelligible, in order that it might, at the first glance, be known to the mercantile and maritime world; that unless it were so, it was obvious that persons in all cases would endeavor to form exceptions for themselves, and instead of certainty they would have uncertainty; instead of security, danger. And in the case of the Ann and Mary, decided in 1843, the Trinity masters observed to the court, speaking of the rule that the vessel on the larboard tack must give way, and where they had applied it with great rigor, that the golden rule so long established must be strictly adhered to, which was, that the vessel <span class=\"star-pagination\">*583</span> on the larboard tack is to give way and the vessel on the starboard tack to hold on; and that the new rule which had been lately made for steam-vessels, namely, each to put the helm a-port, under all doubtful circumstances, assimilated with it. The vessel on the starboard tack puts her helm a-port to keep the wind, and the vessel on the larboard tack does the same to bear away. That the same rule applied to sailing, as well as steam vessels, and if it should be strictly adhered to, there would not be one thousandth part of the accidents which had occurred.</p>\n<p>These rules, which are the results of the practical experience and wisdom of navigators, cannot be too strongly impressed upon the observance of those engaged in the management of vessels on our rivers, or other waters where the course of business and trade naturally confines the navigation to a particular tract or route; and it is the obvious duty of the courts to apply them strictly in all cases of collision, unless where a clear exception is established by the party seeking to excuse himself for a departure.</p>\n<p>Our examination thus far has been confined to the nautical rules governing the navigation of sailing vessels. We have thus confined it, because it will be found that they are generally applicable as rules regulating the navigation in cases where one of the vessels is propelled by steam.</p>\n<p>The striking difference is, that steam-vessels are regarded in the light of vessels navigating with a fair wind, and are always under obligations to do whatever a sailing vessel going free or with a fair wind would be required to do under similar circumstances. Their obligation extends still further, because they possess a power to avoid the collision not belonging to sailing vessels even with a free wind, the master having the steamer under his command, both by altering the helm and by stopping the engines. They are also of vast power and speed compared with craft on our rivers and internal seas propelled by sails, exposing the latter to inevitable destruction in case of collision, and rendering it at all times difficult, and not unfrequently impossible, to get out of their way. Greater caution and vigilance are therefore naturally to be exacted of those in charge of them, to avoid the dangers of the navigation. This justly results from the superior power to direct and control the course and speed of the vessel, and the serious damage consequent upon a failure to avoid the dangers. As a general rule, therefore, when meeting a sailing vessel, whether close-hauled or with the wind free, the latter has a right to keep her course, and it is the duty of the steamer to adopt such precautions as will avoid her. The Shannon, 2 Hagg. Adm. 173; The Perth, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*584</span> 3 Ib. 414; The Rose, 2 Wm. Rob. 1; Hawkins v. The Duchess and Orange Steamboat Co., 2 Wend. 452; 3 Kent, Com. 230; Abbott on Shipping, p. 228 (Boston ed. 1836).</p>\n<p>By an adherence to this rule on the part of the sailing vessel, the steamer with a proper look-out will be enabled, when approaching in an opposite direction, to adopt the necessary measures to avoid the danger, as she will have a right to assume that the sailing vessel will keep her course. If the latter fails to do this, the fault will be attributable to her, and the master of the steamer will be responsible only for a fair exertion of the power of his vessel to avoid the collision under the unexpected change of the course of the other vessel, and the circumstances of the case.</p>\n<p>Recurring now to the facts attending the collision, as disclosed in the court below, and applying the rules of navigation as above stated, and which should have been observed by the respective vessels, we shall be enabled to determine without much difficulty which of them has been in fault.</p>\n<p>The Iole had on board her starboard tacks, and was nearly close-hauled to the wind, and, as we have seen, had a right, and indeed was bound, to keep on her course; and it was the duty of the Neptune to adopt the proper measures to avoid her. There is some discrepancy in the evidence, but the clear weight of it is, that she kept her course till the collision occurred. She was not described by the hands on board the Neptune till the two vessels were from one fourth to three eighths of a mile apart, with a combined speed of sixteen or seventeen miles the hour. She was then, as they supposed, directly ahead. The wheel of the Neptune was immediately put hard a-starboard, with a view to pass the schooner to the windward; and it is supposed by the hands on board that this man\u009cuvre would have cleared her, had she not at the same time changed her course by heading more into the wind. As we have already said, this allegation is not borne out by the evidence. On the contrary, the strong probability is, according to the testimony, that the hands on board the Neptune at the time they first described the schooner mistook her position, and, instead of being on a line with her, that the Neptune was to the leeward, and that, in changing her course and coming up to pass to the windward, they naturally supposed the schooner had changed her course also.</p>\n<p>Besides, she was in fault in attempting to pass the Iole to the windward. Even admitting that she was not mistaken in the position of this vessel, and that she was dead ahead, it was the duty of the Neptune to bear away; and to pass on the larboard side. As we have seen, the observance of no <span class=\"star-pagination\">*585</span> one of the rules of navigation is more strongly recommended, or more steadily enforced, in the admiralty, than this one, where two vessels are approaching in opposite directions, and there is danger of a collision.</p>\n<p>It is observable in this connection, that the pilot in charge of the Neptune seems not to have been properly instructed in his duty in the emergency after the schooner had been discovered ahead, or if he had, that he neglected it; for we find him testifying that, if he had known her course, (which he did not when he gave the order,) he should have thrown his wheel as he did, because the schooner might have hauled off on the wind. And the other pilot on board expressed the opinion, that there was no difficulty whatever in her keeping away and avoiding the Neptune, after seeing her two or three miles off. They seem to have entertained the opinion, that, according to the rules of navigation, it was the duty of the sailing vessel to give way when meeting a vessel propelled by steam; and this even when she was on the starboard tack and nearly close-hauled to the wind. Now, the owner is responsible for damage resulting not only from want of care and attention on the part of those in charge of the vessel, but also from the want of proper knowledge and skill to enable them to manage her according to established nautical rules. Error of judgment will be no defence, especially if resulting from incompetency. And erroneous opinions of duty on the part of those in the immediate management and control of the vessel naturally turn a doubt, arising from conflicting evidence upon a question whether or not a proper direction was given in the emergency, against them.</p>\n<p>We are also satisfied, that the steamboat was in fault in not keeping at the time a proper look-out on the forward part of the deck; and that the failure to descry the schooner at a greater distance than half a mile ahead is attributable to this neglect. The pilot-house, in the night, especially if dark, and the view obscured by clouds in the distance, was not the proper place, whether the windows were up or down. The view of a look-out stationed there must necessarily have been partially obstructed. A competent and vigilant look-out stationed at the forward part of the vessel, and in a position best adapted to descry vessels approaching at the earliest moment, is indispensable to exempt the steamboat from blame in case of accident in the night-time, while navigating waters on which it is accustomed to meet other water craft.</p>\n<p>There is nothing harsh or unreasonable in this rule; and its strict observance and enforcement will be found as beneficial to the interest of the owners as to the safety of navigation; <span class=\"star-pagination\">*586</span> a remark equally true in respect to every other nautical rule, which the results of experience have shown enter so materially into the proper management of the vessel.</p>\n<p>It has been insisted, that the schooner was in fault in not carrying a light, so as to enable the vessels approaching to see her at a greater distance. But all agree that it was a clear, starlight night, and hence there could be no difficulty, with a proper look-out, in seeing to a sufficient distance to enable the steamer to make the proper movement to avoid her. It is not usual for sailing vessels to carry lights on such a night.</p>\n<p>It is true, some of the witnesses on the part of the Neptune speak of a black cloud in the eastern horizon, which obscured the view from vessels going in that direction. But the allegation is not maintained by the evidence to an extent that would justify us in attributing to it any material importance.</p>\n<p>Upon the whole, we are satisfied the decree below is right, and must be affirmed.</p>\n<p>Mr. Justice DANIEL dissented from the opinion of the court in this case, and also in that of Newton v. Stebbins. For his opinion, see the conclusion of the last-mentioned case, which follows the present.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Order.</h2>\n<p>This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is ordered and decreed by this court, that the decree of the said Circuit Court in this cause be, and the same is hereby, affirmed, with costs and damages at the rate of six per centum per annum.</p>\n</div>",

If the latter fails to do this, the fault will be attributable to her, and the master of the steamer will be responsible only for a fair exertion of the power of his vessel to avoid the collision under the unexpected change of the course of the other vessel, and the circumstances of the case.</p>\n<p>Recurring now to the facts attending the collision, as disclosed in the court below, and applying the rules of navigation as above stated, and which should have been observed by the respective vessels, we shall be enabled to determine without much difficulty which of them has been in fault.</p>\n<p>The Iole had on board her starboard tacks, and was nearly close-hauled to the wind, and, as we have seen, had a right, and indeed was bound, to keep on her course; and it was the duty of the Neptune to adopt the proper measures to avoid her. There is some discrepancy in the evidence, but the clear weight of it is, that she kept her course till the collision occurred. She was not described by the hands on board the Neptune till the two vessels were from one fourth to three eighths of a mile apart, with a combined speed of sixteen or seventeen miles the hour. She was then, as they supposed, directly ahead. The wheel of the Neptune was immediately put hard a-starboard, with a view to pass the schooner to the windward; and it is supposed by the hands on board that this man\u009cuvre would have cleared her, had she not at the same time changed her course by heading more into the wind. As we have already said, this allegation is not borne out by the evidence. On the contrary, the strong probability is, according to the testimony, that the hands on board the Neptune at the time they first described the schooner mistook her position, and, instead of being on a line with her, that the Neptune was to the leeward, and that, in changing her course and coming up to pass to the windward, they naturally supposed the schooner had changed her course also.</p>\n<p>Besides, she was in fault in attempting to pass the Iole to the windward. Even admitting that she was not mistaken in the position of this vessel, and that she was dead ahead, it was the duty of the Neptune to bear away; and to pass on the larboard side. As we have seen, the observance of no <span class=\"star-pagination\">*585</span> one of the rules of navigation is more strongly recommended, or more steadily enforced, in the admiralty, than this one, where two vessels are approaching in opposite directions, and there is danger of a collision.</p>\n<p>It is observable in this connection, that the pilot in charge of the Neptune seems not to have been properly instructed in his duty in the emergency after the schooner had been discovered ahead, or if he had, that he neglected it; for we find him testifying that, if he had known her course, (which he did not when he gave the order,) he should have thrown his wheel as he did, because the schooner might have hauled off on the wind. And the other pilot on board expressed the opinion, that there was no difficulty whatever in her keeping away and avoiding the Neptune, after seeing her two or three miles off. They seem to have entertained the opinion, that, according to the rules of navigation, it was the duty of the sailing vessel to give way when meeting a vessel propelled by steam; and this even when she was on the starboard tack and nearly close-hauled to the wind. Now, the owner is responsible for damage resulting not only from want of care and attention on the part of those in charge of the vessel, but also from the want of proper knowledge and skill to enable them to manage her according to established nautical rules. Error of judgment will be no defence, especially if resulting from incompetency. And erroneous opinions of duty on the part of those in the immediate management and control of the vessel naturally turn a doubt, arising from conflicting evidence upon a question whether or not a proper direction was given in the emergency, against them.</p>\n<p>We are also satisfied, that the steamboat was in fault in not keeping at the time a proper look-out on the forward part of the deck; and that the failure to descry the schooner at a greater distance than half a mile ahead is attributable to this neglect. The pilot-house, in the night, especially if dark, and the view obscured by clouds in the distance, was not the proper place, whether the windows were up or down. The view of a look-out stationed there must necessarily have been partially obstructed. A competent and vigilant look-out stationed at the forward part of the vessel, and in a position best adapted to descry vessels approaching at the earliest moment, is indispensable to exempt the steamboat from blame in case of accident in the night-time, while navigating waters on which it is accustomed to meet other water craft.</p>\n<p>There is nothing harsh or unreasonable in this rule; and its strict observance and enforcement will be found as beneficial to the interest of the owners as to the safety of navigation; <span class=\"star-pagination\">*586</span> a remark equally true in respect to every other nautical rule, which the results of experience have shown enter so materially into the proper management of the vessel.</p>\n<p>It has been insisted, that the schooner was in fault in not carrying a light, so as to enable the vessels approaching to see her at a greater distance. But all agree that it was a clear, starlight night, and hence there could be no difficulty, with a proper look-out, in seeing to a sufficient distance to enable the steamer to make the proper movement to avoid her. It is not usual for sailing vessels to carry lights on such a night.</p>\n<p>It is true, some of the witnesses on the part of the Neptune speak of a black cloud in the eastern horizon, which obscured the view from vessels going in that direction. But the allegation is not maintained by the evidence to an extent that would justify us in attributing to it any material importance.</p>\n<p>Upon the whole, we are satisfied the decree below is right, and must be affirmed.</p>\n<p>Mr. Justice DANIEL dissented from the opinion of the court in this case, and also in that of Newton v. Stebbins. For his opinion, see the conclusion of the last-mentioned case, which follows the present.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Order.</h2>\n<p>This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is ordered and decreed by this court, that the decree of the said Circuit Court in this cause be, and the same is hereby, affirmed, with costs and damages at the rate of six per centum per annum.</p>\n</div>",

That the said schooner Iole, belonging and owned in Eastport, aforesaid, whereof the said Joseph Sumner was master, on or about the 7th of July, 1846, set sail and departed from the port of Eastport, in the state of Maine, aforesaid, with the said Joseph Sumner as master, having on board of said schooner a cargo consisting of laths, pickets, plaster, fish in barrels, thirty empty barrels, and two barrels of beer, and two packages of money, bound for the port of New York; and that the said schooner was then tight, stanch, and strong, and well manned, tackled, apparelled, and appointed, and was, in every respect, fit for the voyage the so undertook.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'2d. That in the evening of the 14th day of July, aforesaid, the said schooner, with three passengers, and with the said cargo on board, had successfully proceeded in and upon her said voyage past and about one mile to the south of the light-boat stationed off the Middle Ground, a shoal nearly opposite to Stratford Point, and that the said schooner passed the light-boat, being about one mile to the southward thereof.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'That the said schooner was then steering about a west course, the wind being nearly from the north; that the night was clear, and the said vessel could be easily discerned at a considerable distance; that whilst sailing upon her course, about west, with a fresh wind, going at from six to eight knots per hour, and a short time after the said schooner had passed the said light-boat, and between the hours of nine and ten o'clock at night, on the high seas, and within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of this court, she was negligently run against and into, by the said steamboat Neptune, which steamboat eas then and there proceeding down the Sound from the city of New York; and the said steamboat then and there run and struck against the hull of the said schooner, between the fore and main rigging, on her larboard side, with such great force and violence as to break and tear open the hull of the said schooner, and cut her nearly in two, so that she filled and sunk almost immediately; and the said vessel and her cargo, and the clothes, money, and personal effects of the crew and passengers were totally lost; and two of the passengers, viz., a female named Murphy, and her child, were drowned.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'3d. That the crew of said schooner and one of the passengers, viz ., the libellant Augustus Norton, saved their lives by jumping from the said schooner on to the deck of the said steamboat; that they made inquiries for the captain of the said steamboat, but could find no captain on board; that they asked those on board of said steamboat to despatch a boat with assistance, to endeavor to save the lives of the woman and child aforesaid; but that, no assistance being offered or given, two of the crew of the said schooner, with two of the passengers of the steamboat, took the small boat of the said steamboat, and went in search of the said female and child, but that their efforts were unavailing, the said schooner having sunk, and the said female and child having disappeared.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'4th. That the said steamboat was at the time aforesaid carelessly, improperly, and unskilfully navigated, and that the loss of the said schooner, with the cargo on board thereof, and the clothes, money, and effects of the crew and passengers, and the lives of the said female and child, was occasioned solely by the fault, carelessness, and unskilful management of the said steamboat. That the crew, and those having the control and management of the said steamboat, as your libellants are informed and believe, were inexperienced in the command of the said steamboat, and were incompetent, unskilful, and insufficient, or else were careless and negligent, and by their want of skill, or carelessness and negligence, occasioned the said disaster, without the fault of the said schooner and her crew. That Long Island Sound, where the disaster occurred, is very wide, and there was ample room for the said steamboat to have passed and avoided that said schooner without any difficulty whatever.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'5th. That the said schooner or vessel, called the Iole, her tackle, apparel, and furniture, at the time of the said collision, was of the value of three thousand dollars of thereabouts, and was owned and possessed as follows; that is to say, the libellant Zebulon A. Paine was the owner of one equal half part thereof, and the libellant, Sarah Norwood was the owner of the other half part thereof.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'6th. That the libellant Zebulon A. Paine was at the time of the said collision the owner of two hundred thousand laths, 4900 pickets, and 1725 &#167; pickets, thirty-five tons of plaster, and thirty-nine barrels of fish, shipped by him on board of the said schooner upon the said voyage, which were of the value of five hundred and fifty dollars, or thereabouts, and which cargo so shipped by him was totally lost by the said collision.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'7th. That the libellant John Bucknam was at the time of the said collision the owner of thirty-six barrels of pickled fish, which he had shipped at Eastport aforesaid, on board of the said schooner, and which was totally lost by the said collision, and which last-mentioned cargo was of the value of one hundred and seventeen dollars or thereabouts.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'8th. That the libellant Andrew Bradford was at the time of the said collision owner of thirty empty beer-barrels, and two barrels containing beer, which he had shipped on board of the said schooner at Eastport aforesaid, to be carried to New York, and which last-mentioned cargo was totally lost by the said collision.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'9th. That the libellants Zebulon A. Paine and Sarah Norwood have also lost, in consequence of the said collision, the freight and passage money which the said schooner would have earned upon the delivery of said cargo in New York, and have been deprived of the use and employment of the said schooner, and have been interrupted in their business and mercantile pursuits, to their great loss and damage.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'10th. That the libellant Joseph Sumner saith, that he was the owner of, and had on board of the said schooner at the time of the collision aforesaid, and totally lost, the articles, property, and effects enumerated and specified in the schedule hereto annexed, marked A, which he prays may be taken as a part thereof; which articles, property, and effects are truly valued in the said schedule.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'That the libellant James McCollar saith, that he had on board, and was the owner of, at the time of the said collision, and totally lost, the articles, property, and effects specified in schedule B, hereto annexed, and which he prays may be taken as a part of this libel, and that the value of said several articles is truly set forth therein. That the libellant Ambrose Tucker saith, that he was the owner of, and had on board of the said schooner at the time aforesaid, and totally lost, the property and effects specified, and being of the value stated, in schedule C, hereto annexed, and which he prays may be taken as a part of this libel. That the libellant James Woorster saith, that he was at the time of the said collision the owner of, and had on board the said schooner, and totally lost by the said collision, the property and effects specified and being of the value stated in the schedule hereto annexed, marked D, and which he prays may be taken as a part of this libel. That the libellant Henry Cuff said, that he was the owner of, and had on board of the said schooner at the time of the collision aforesaid, and totally lost, the articles mentioned in the schedule hereto annexed, marked E, being of the value therein stated, and which schedule he prays may be taken as a part of this libel. That the libellants Joseph Sumner, James McCollar, Ambrose Tucker, James Woorster, and Henry Cuff, were sailing in and on board of the said schooner, on monthly wages, and that they have been thrown out of employ and put to much expense and loss.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'That the libellant Augustus Norton saith, that he was a passenger on board of said schooner, and that he was the owner of, and had on board at the time of the said collision, the property and effects specified in schedule F, hereto annexed, and which he prays may be taken as a part of this libel; and that the said property and effects are truly valued in the said schedule, and they were wholly lost to him, and that in consequence he is now destitute, having saved nothing but one shirt, and that he has suffered great inconvenience, anxiety, and delay by reason of the said loss.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'11th. That after information of the loss of the said schooner and her cargo, as aforesaid, was received in New York, the libellants' agents in said city caused application to be made to George Law, who, as they are informed and believe, was at the time of the said collision the owner of the said steamboat, to pay the damages which the steamboat had improperly, carelessly, and negligently occasioned as aforesaid, but that he refused to comply with such request.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'12th. That all and singular the matters aforesaid are true, and within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of this honorable court, and that the said vessel, here tackle, apparel, &amp;c., is within the district, and in verification thereof, if denied, the libellants crave leave to refer to the depositions and other proofs to be by them exhibited in this cause.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Wherefore the libellants pray, thay process in due form of law, according to the course and practice of courts of admiralty, and of this honorable court in causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, may issue against the said steamboat Neptune, her tackle, apparel, and furniture, and that all persons having or pretending to have any right, title, or interest therein may be cited to appear and answer upon oath all and singular the premises. And that this honorable court will be pleased to pronounce for the damages aforesaid, and to decree such other relief to the libellants as shall to law and justice appertain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Also to condemn the said steamboat, her tackle, apparel, and furniture, and all persons intervening for their interest therein, in costs and expenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'JOSEPH SUMNER,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">E.

St. John, of the city of New York, in the district aforesaid, intervening for his interest in the steamboat Neptune, appears before the honorable court, and for answer to the libel and complaint of Zebulon A. Paine of Eastport, in the state of Maine, Sarah Norwood of same place, and John Bucknam, Andrew Bradford, Joseph Sumner, James McCollar, Ambrose Tucker, James Woorster, Henry Cuff, Augustus Norton, against the steamboat Neptune, and all parties intervening for their interest in the same, propounds as follows:&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'1st. That the respondent, at the time in the said libel set forth, to wit, on the 14th day of July aforesaid, and before and afterwards, was the lawful owner of the said steamboat Neptune, a vessel of 720 tons, or thereabouts, now in the service of the United States, and having sailed for Texas or Mexico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'2d. And the respondent, as to the allegations of the said libellants, and each of them, in the first, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth articles of the said libel contained, says that he is ignorant of and not informed concerning the same save by the said libel, and cannot therefore admit or deny the same to be true, but leaves the same to be proved according to the custom and practice of this court. And the said respondent further alleges and propounds, that the matters in the second, third, and fourth articles of the said libel are in great part falsely alleged, and that the truth is, as this respondent is informed and believes, as is hereinafter particularly propounded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'3d. That the said steamboat Neptune, being in good order and well and sufficiently equipped and manned, sailed from the port of New York, in the state of New York, at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 14th day of July, 1846, bound for Newport and Providence, in the state of Rhode Island; and, in prosecution of her voyage, proceeded on her passage, at her regular rate, until about one mile from Stratford light-boat, when, at or about eight or ten o'clock in the evening, a vessel was seen about half a quarter of a mile ahead, which vessel the respondent understood to have been the schooner Iole, as is alleged in said libel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'4th. That, immediately on seeing the said schooner Iole, the course of the said Steamboat Neptune was changed to windward of the said schooner, for the purpose of giving said schooner the course she was then running. That when the said steamboat was about ten or twelve lengths from the said schooner, it was observed that the latter had changed her course, and was luffing up so as to cross the bows of the said steamboat. That, when first seen, said schooner was running west by south, from which she changed suddenly to about northwest. That, on seeing that said schooner had changed her course, the bell of the steamboat was immediately rung to stop her, and all efforts made to avoid the collision; but the said schooner came directly across the bows of the said steamboat, and, the latter having some headway, a collision could not be avoided. That the said schooner was struck about midships, and her crew at once jumped from the rigging on board the said steamboat. That the first report was, that no one was left on board the schooner; the next was, that a female and child were left on board, upon hearing which a small boat was immediately lowered from the Neptune, and sufficiently manned, and every other possible effort was made for the purpose of saving the persons on board of the said schooner; but that, before or about the time the boat could be lowered, the said schooner disappeared; but whether any person or persons were in her at the time she sunk, this respondent is not informed, save by the said libel, and cannot state. That the captain of the said steamboat, and the men with him who manned the said small boat, continued to row about the place of the disappearance of the said schooner for more than half an hour; but, finding no person or persons needing their aid, they returned to the Neptune. That, at the urgent request of the said passengers on board the said steamboat, who feared she might have become leaky by the collision, the said boat returned to New York; and, on being examined, was found to be in safe condition, only injured a little at the bows, and fully able to have continued her voyage in safety.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'5th. That Thomas J. Davis was, at the time of the occurrence aforesaid, master and captain of said steamboat, and had been on board of her for a year or more preceding; and that Nathan Child, former captain of said boat, a pilot accustomed to conduct and manage steamboats in the harbor of New York and on the route said boat was then proceeding, and John Driver, a wheelsman familiar and experienced in the management of said boat, and who had been employed on board of her the preceding seven years, were in the pilot-house, at the wheel, at the time of the said occurrence; and that all and every of said persons were skilful and sufficient in the management of said boat, and were in no way, nor were the crew employed in said boat, inexperienced, incompetent, unskilful, insufficient, careless, or negligent in the management of said steamboat, as is falsely alleged in the fourth article of the libel aforesaid; nor was the said steamboat, at the said time carelessly, improperly, or unskilfully navigated; nor was the loss of the said schooner and cargo and other effects in the said libel named, nor the lives of the said woman and child, if any such loss took place, occasioned by the fault, carelessness, or unskilful management of the steamboat, as is also falsely alleged in the said fourth article of the said libel aforesaid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'6th. That the reason why the said schooner was not seen earlier than at the distance of one quarter of a mile was, that a heavy black cloud shut her out from view, and she had no lights visible on board which could enable the captain, or pilot, or the other wheelsman, or any of the crew of the said steamboat, to discover the said schooner sooner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'7th. That, as soon as the said schooner was seen, the course of the said steamboat was immediately changed, according to the rule customary in such cases, so as to give the schooner the course she was pursuing. That this threw the broadside of the Neptune to view from the schooner, so that the man at the wheel on board the schooner saw the head and stern lights of the steamboat more distinctly, and her course was plainly seen by him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'8th. That the wind was blowing fresh, and the luffing up of the schooner so as to cross the bows of the steamboat, when the position and course of the latter were so evidence to those on board the schooner, could not have been expected by any person on board the steamboat, and was contrary to all proper and lawful rules of navigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'9th. That the said captain, pilot, wheelsman, and crew of the said steamboat Neptune used the greatest skill and care in the management of the same on the night aforesaid, and took every possible precaution to prevent the occurrence of any accident; and that the said steamboat did not in any manner negligently run against the said schooner, as is falsely alleged in the second article of the said libel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'10th. That, on the occurrence of the said accident, the captain of the said steamboat, with a sufficient number of his crew, manned the small boat, and went in her, so as to afford every possible assistance to the persons or property on board the said schooner; and the allegations in the third article of the said libel, that no captain could be found on board of said steamboat, and that no assistance was offered or given to save the lives of those on board of the said schooner, are false.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'11th.

Weather was clear, except black cloud at east. Between nine and ten the cloud was about two hours high, or at height of sun at two hours above horizon, and closed down to horizon, and spread northeast and southeast. Neptune was running east by north. Witness stood in front part of wheel-house, midships, on the look-out. Driver had the wheel. Witness was at middle window of wheel-house, about the middle of the boat. Wheelsman was under his directions. Could then see ahead from one fourth to three eighths of a mile, so as to discern an object; should not think could see any thing, except a light, farther off. Neptune was going at about ten miles the hour. About twenty-five minutes before ten, first saw schooner (Iole), north; was then about one mile and a half from light-boat, Stratford shore light bearing east by north one half north. Schooner was then directly ahead; could just discern her by side of flagpole. Wind was about north; quite a strong breeze. Could not tell what course of schooner was; could not see her plain enough.

If she had altered her course a very trifle, by falling off at any time within a mile, she could have easily cleared the Neptune. As soon as struck, crew of schooner got on board Neptune. Boat of Neptune was immediately lowered, and sent out to see if could find any body. It returned without finding any person; and captain took it himself, with lantern, and went out again, and was out with it about twenty-five minutes. Came back without finding any person. She was then hoisted up, and Neptune started, first northward, and directly across the Sound; from collision three quarters to one hour Neptune lay by before going on; found Neptune leaking some; and, after consultation, it was thought more prudent to return to New York.

At this time the Iole appeared to the Neptune to be approaching or receding in nearly the same line, her sails being seen edgewise, and the Neptune appeared to be in the act of crossing her line to the northward, she being seen over the starboard bow of the Neptune, which is fully established by the specific observations of the witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p143\">\n      <span class=\"num\">143</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V. The evidence that the Neptune, at the distance of six miles from the Iole, was on a line south of that of the Iole, and so as to pass the Iole to the south of her, is too weak to overcome the clear and decisive evidence on the last point, even assuming them to be competent witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These witnesses were interested and incompetent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p145\">\n      <span class=\"num\">145</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To hit the Iole as she did, (the Iole keeping her course,) and to come up directly towards her, the Neptune must have changed her course to due north, or north by west, which is not only improbable, but contradicted decidedly by the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p146\">\n      <span class=\"num\">146</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VI. Assuming it to be true, and that the Neptune changed her course to the northward, some five or six minutes prior to the collision, it was so changed as to bring her in the position stated in the fourth point; and she was in that position when the Iole was first discovered by her, as the evidence decisively shows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p147\">\n      <span class=\"num\">147</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VII. If the Neptune changed her course five or six minutes before the collision, so as to bring her in the position stated in the fourth point, she was not in fault in making the change, because she did not (and could not) then see the Iole.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p148\">\n      <span class=\"num\">148</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VIII.

By stopping her course, she would have been in danger of being run into while at rest by a moving body, thereby endangering the lives of her passengers; it being the duty of passenger vessels to use every precaution of diligence, industry, and skill to save the lives of their passengers. 2 Kent Com., 601, 602; <i>Cristie</i> v. <i>Griggs</i>, 2 Campb., N.

It was highly expedient that both vessels, on account of the proximity, should be active in endeavoring to avoid collision, and that neither should keep her course, and the Neptune was bound to act on that supposition. <i>The Friends</i>, 1 Wm.

It was proper that the Neptune should go to the windward; the deviation in that direction on her part was easier, as she was crossing the line of the Iole in that direction, and the Iole could bear away to the leeward more readily than she could luff towards the wind. <i>The Shannon</i>, 1 Wm.

The Neptune would have avoided the Iole, if the Iole had even kept her course; more especially, if she had borne away to the leeward, when she saw the change of course of the steamboat towards the north, by her lights.

That immediately on seeing the vessel, the course of the Neptune was changed to windward for the purpose of giving her the course she was running. That when the Neptune was about ten or twelve lengths from the schooner, it was seen that she had changed her course, and was luffing up into the wind so as to cross the bows of the steamboat. That when first seen, the Iole was running west by south, from which she changed suddenly to about northwest; that, on seeing she had changed her course, the bell of the Neptune was immediately rung to stop her, and all efforts made to avoid the collision; but that the schooner came directly across the bows of the steamboat, and, the latter having still some headway, a collision could not be avoided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p189\">\n      <span class=\"num\">189</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It will be seen from these allegations of the respective parties, that the issue between them, and upon which the case must turn in favor of the one or the other, is a very simple one, whether we have regard to the law or to the facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p190\">\n      <span class=\"num\">190</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statement of the Iole is, that she was proceeding on a west course up the Sound, nearly close-hauled to the wind, with her starboard tacks on board, at the rate of about seven knots an hour; and that, while keeping on this course, the Neptune, in an improper manoeuvre to cross her trail, and pass to the windward, struck her near midships on the larboard side, and sunk her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p191\">\n      <span class=\"num\">191</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The allegation of the Neptune does not vary substantially from this statement, except that it charges the collision to the fault of the Iole in not keeping on her course, but suddenly changing it by throwing her head into the wind, and thereby placing her athwart the track of the steamboat as she was in the act of passing to the windward.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p192\">\n      <span class=\"num\">192</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The general question involved in the case is, which of these vessels has been in fault; and this will depend upon the evidence produced by each in the court below, together with the application of the rules of navigation to be observed by them at the time of the collision, and with a view to avoid it, having regard to their relative position and course; and, more especially, the application of these rules under the facts and circumstances, in a case where the colliding vessel is propelled by steam, and the other by sails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p193\">\n      <span class=\"num\">193</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among the nautical rules applicable to the navigation of sailing vessels are the following, viz.:&#8212;A vessel that has the wind free, or sailing before or with the wind, must get out of the way of the vessel that is close-hauled, or sailing by or against it; and the vessel on the starboard tack has a right to keep her course, and the one on the larboard tack must give way, or be answerable for the consequences. So, when two vessels are approaching each other, both having the wind free, and consequently the power of readily controling their movements, the vessel on the larboard tack must give way, and each pass to the right. The same rule governs vessels sailing on the wind and approaching each other, when it is doubtful which is to windward. But if the vessel on the larboard tack is so far to windward that, if both persist in their course, the other will strike her on the lee side abaft the beam or near the stern, in that case the vessel on the starboard tack should give way, as she can do so with greater facility and less loss of time and distance than the other. Again, when vessels are crossing each other in opposite directions, and there is the least doubt of their going clear, the vessel on the starboard tack should persevere in her course, while that on the larboard tack should bear up, or keep away before the wind. <i>The Friends</i>, 1 Wm.

Either vessel may find herself in a position at the time when it would be impossible to conform to them without certain peril to herself, or a collision with the approaching vessel. Under such circumstances, the master must necessarily be thrown upon the resources of his own judgment and skill in extricating his own vessel, as well as the vessel approaching, from the impending peril. These cases cannot be anticipated, and therefore cannot be provided for by any fixed regulation. They can only be examined, and the management of the vessel approved or condemned, as the case may arise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p195\">\n      <span class=\"num\">195</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But no one can look through the reports in admiralty in England without being struck with the steadiness and rigor with which these general nautical rules have been enforced in cases of collision, under the advice of the Trinity masters of that court, or fail to be impressed with the justice and propriety of such application, and the salutary results flowing from it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p196\">\n      <span class=\"num\">196</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case of the <i>Traveller</i>, an exception was set up by the colliding vessel, on the ground that the other, when first descried, was about two points on her lee bow. This was denied. But the court declined to enter into a minute examination as to which of the statements was correct, observing that it had been distinctly laid down, over and over again, that when two vessels on opposite tacks are approaching each other, and there is a probability of collision, it is the duty of the vessel on the larboard to give way at once, without considering whether the other vessel be one or more points to leeward. And, in the case of the <i>Friends</i>, the court, where an exception was attempted to be engrafted on the Trinity rules, in submitting the case to the Trinity masters, recommended that, for the sake of the safe navigation of the Thames and the great interests which are daily and hourly there at stake, the exception, if any were to be made, should be clear, definite, and intelligible, in order that it might, at the first glance, be known to the mercantile and maritime world; that unless it were so, it was obvious that persons in all cases would endeavor to form exceptions for themselves, and instead of certainty they would have uncertainty; instead of security, danger. And in the case of the <i>Ann</i> and <i>Mary</i>, decided in 1843, the Trinity masters observed to the court, speaking of the rule that the vessel on the larboard tack must give way, and where they had applied it with great rigor, that the golden rule so long established must be strictly adhered to, which was, that the vessel on the larboard tack is to give way and the vessel on the starboard tack to hold on; and that the new rule which had been lately made for steam-vessels, namely, each to put the helm a-port, under all doubtful circumstances, assimilated with it. The vessel on the starboard tack puts her helm a-port to keep the wind, and the vessel on the larboard tack does the same to bear away. That the same rule applied to sailing, as well as steam vessels, and if it should be strictly adhered to, there would not be one thousandth part of the accidents which had occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p197\">\n      <span class=\"num\">197</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These rules, which are the results of the practical experience and wisdom of navigators, cannot be too strongly impressed upon the observance of those engaged in the management of vessels on our rivers, or other waters where the course of business and trade naturally confines the navigation to a particular tract or route; and it is the obvious duty of the courts to apply them strictly in all cases of collision, unless where a clear exception is established by the party seeking to excuse himself for a departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p198\">\n      <span class=\"num\">198</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our examination thus far has been confined to the nautical rules governing the navigation of sailing vessels. We have thus confined it, because it will be found that they are generally applicable as rules regulating the navigation in cases where one of the vessels is propelled by steam.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p199\">\n      <span class=\"num\">199</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The striking difference is, that steam-vessels are regarded in the light of vessels navigating with a fair wind, and are always under obligations to do whatever a sailing vessel going free or with a fair wind would be required to do under similar circumstances. Their obligation extends still further, because they possess a power to avoid the collision not belonging to sailing vessels even with a free wind, the master having the steamer under his command, both by altering the helm and by stopping the engines. They are also of vast power and speed compared with craft on our rivers and internal seas propelled by sails, exposing the latter to inevitable destruction in case of collision, and rendering it at all times difficult, and not unfrequently impossible, to get out of their way. Greater caution and vigilance are therefore naturally to be exacted of those in charge of them, to avoid the dangers of the navigation. This justly results from the superior power to direct and control the course and speed of the vessel, and the serious damage consequent upon a failure to avoid the dangers. As a general rule, therefore, when meeting a sailing vessel, whether close-hauled or with the wind free, the latter has a right to keep her course, and it is the duty of the steamer to adopt such precautions as will avoid her. <i>The Shannon</i>, 2 Hagg. Adm., 173; <i>The Perth</i>, 3 Id., 414; <i>The Rose</i>, 2 W. Rob., 1; <i>Hawkins</i> v. <i>The Duchess and Orange Steamboat Co.</i>, 2 Wend. (N.

If the latter fails to do this, the fault will be attributable to her, and the master of the steamer will be responsible only for a fair exertion of the power of his vessel to avoid the collision under the unexpected change of the course of the other vessel, and the circumstances of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p201\">\n      <span class=\"num\">201</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recurring now to the facts attending the collision, as disclosed in the court below, and applying the rules of navigation as above stated, and which should have been observed by the respective vessels, we shall be enabled to determine without much difficulty which of them has been in fault.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p202\">\n      <span class=\"num\">202</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Iole had on board her starboard tacks, and was nearly close-hauled to the wind, and, as we have seen, had a right, and indeed was bound, to keep on her course; and it was the duty of the Neptune to adopt the proper measures to avoid her. There is some discrepancy in the evidence, but the clear weight of it is, that she kept her course till the collision occurred. She was not described by the hands on board the Neptune till the two vessels were from one fourth to three eighths of a mile apart, with a combined speed of sixteen or seventeen miles the hour. She was then, as they supposed, directly ahead. The wheel of the Neptune was immediately put hard a-starboard, with a view to pass the schooner to the windward; and it is supposed by the hands on board that this manoeuvre would have cleared her, had she not at the same time changed her course by heading more into the wind. As we have already said, this allegation is not borne out by the evidence. On the contrary, the strong probability is, according to the testimony, that the hands on board the Neptune at the time they first descried the schooner mistook her position, and, instead of being on a line with her, that the Neptune was to the leeward, and that, in changing her course and coming up to pass to the windward, they naturally supposed the schooner had changed her course also.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p203\">\n      <span class=\"num\">203</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Besides, she was in fault in attempting to pass the Iole to the windward. Even admitting that she was not mistaken in the position of this vessel, and that she was dead ahead, it was the duty of the Neptune to bear away; and to pass on the larboard side. As we have seen, the observance of no one of the rules of navigation is more strongly recommended, or more steadily enforced, in the admiralty, than this one, where two vessels are approaching in opposite directions, and there is danger of a collision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p204\">\n      <span class=\"num\">204</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is observable in this connection, that the pilot in charge of the Neptune seems not to have been properly instructed in his duty in the emergency after the schooner had been discovered ahead, or if he had, that he neglected it; for we find him testifying that, if he had known her course, (which he did not when he gave the order,) he should have thrown his wheel as he did, because the schooner might have hauled off on the wind. And the other pilot on board expressed the opinion, that there was no difficulty whatever in her keeping away and avoiding the Neptune, after seeing her two or three miles off. They seem to have entertained the opinion that, according to the rules of navigation, it was the duty of the sailing vessel to give way when meeting a vessel propelled by steam; and this even when she was on the starboard tack and nearly closehauled to the wind. Now, the owner is responsible for damage resulting not only from want of care and attention on the part of those in charge of the vessel, but also from the want of proper knowledge and skill to enable them to manage her according to established nautical rules. Error of judgment will be no defence, especially if resulting from incompetency. And erroneous opinions of duty on the part of those in the immediate management and control of the vessel naturally turn a doubt, arising from conflicting evidence upon a question whether or not a proper direction was given in the emergency, against them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p205\">\n      <span class=\"num\">205</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are also satisfied, that the steamboat was in fault in not keeping at the time a proper look-out on the forward part of the deck; and that the failure to descry the schooner at a greater distance than half a mile ahead is attributable to this neglect. The pilot-house, in the night, especially if dark, and the view obscured by clouds in the distance, was not the proper place, whether the windows were up or down. The view of a look-out stationed there must necessarily have been partially obstructed. A competent and vigilant look-out stationed at the forward part of the vessel, and in a position best adapted to descry vessels approaching at the earliest moment, is indispensable to exempt the steamboat from blame in case of accident in the night time, while navigating waters on which it is accoustomed to meet other water craft.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p206\">\n      <span class=\"num\">206</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is nothing harsh or unreasonable in this rule; and its strict observance and enforcement will be found as beneficial to the interest of the owners as to the safety of navigation; a remark equally true in respect to every other nautical rule, which the results of experience have shown enter so materially into the proper management of the vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p207\">\n      <span class=\"num\">207</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It has been insisted, that the schooner was in fault in not carrying a light, so as to enable the vessels approaching to see her at a greater distance. But all agree that it was a clear, starlight night, and hence there could be no difficulty, with a proper look-out, in seeing to a sufficient distance to enable the steamer to make the proper movement to avoid her. It is not usual for sailing vessels to carry lights on such a night.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p208\">\n      <span class=\"num\">208</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true, some of the witnesses on the part of the Neptune speak of a black cloud in the eastern horizon, which obscured the view from vessels going in that direction. But the allegation is not maintained by the evidence to an extent that would justify us in attributing to it any material importance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p209\">\n      <span class=\"num\">209</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon the whole, we are satisfied the decree below is right, and must be affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p210\">\n      <span class=\"num\">210</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice DANIEL dissented from the opinion of the court in this case, and also in that of <i>Newton</i> v. <i>Stebbins</i>. For his opinion, see the conclusion of the last-mentioned case, which follows the present.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\"><i>Order</i>.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p211\">\n      <span class=\"num\">211</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circut Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is ordered and decreed by this court, that the decree of the said Circuit Court in this cause be, and the same is hereby affirmed, with costs and damages at the rate of six per centum per annum.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
