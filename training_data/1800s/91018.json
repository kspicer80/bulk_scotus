The stipulation bears date November 15, 1883. It was filed here on the twelfth of December. By its terms the counsel for the plaintiff in error was to have until the twelfth of December to serve and file his printed argument; the counsel for the defendant in error until the twenty-fifth of December to serve and file his printed argument; and the counsel for the plaintiff in error 10 days to reply. No argument has been filed in behalf of plaintiff in error, but one was filed in behalf of the defendant in error on the fifteenth of December. On the last day for submitting cases under the rule, which was after the expiration of the time the plaintiff in error was entitled to for his reply, the defendant in error submitted the case under the stipulation. In <i>Muller</i> v. <i>Dows</i>, 94 U.
