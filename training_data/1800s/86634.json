He died, having executed a will and made the defendant his executrix. She filed her petition in the Probate Court at New Orleans, and was duly authorized to act as executrix. At the decease of her husband, it is alleged, a large amount of property came into her hands as executrix, which she used for her own benefit, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*152</span> and neglected to pay the debts of the estate. And it averred that a misapplication of the funds has made the defendant liable in her individual capacity, and the plaintiff prays that she may be condemned to pay the above sum, &amp;c.</p>\n<p>The defendant demurs to the petition, on the ground that it is not sufficient in law to charge her, for want of parties, and that the matters are only cognizable in chancery. And she answers that she has fully administered, having made a full inventory of the property of said succession, and used all proper diligence to collect the debts, and disposed of the property in obedience to the order of the court; made reports of her acts, and presented a formal tableau of distribution, which was duly approved and homologated by the Probate Court. That the estate proved to be insolvent, and that the defendant is a creditor, recognized as such by the proper tribunal, and is entitled to a preference, &amp;c.</p>\n<p>At the trial the suit was dismissed, at the plaintiff's costs.</p>\n<p>This was a procedure at law under the forms adopted by Louisiana, and the question is, whether it is maintainable. The plaintiff demands a judgment de bonis propriis, against the defendant, no other step having been taken, or notice given, before the commencement of the present action. At common law an executor or administrator is not chargeable on a devastavit, until a judgment shall be obtained against him. He is bound to defend himself by legal pleading, and can have no relief in equity. If he suffer judgment by default, it is an admission of assets, and also if he file a plea in bar which he knows to be false. So if he pleads only the general issue, and has a verdict against him. If he plead plene administravil, and on this plea assets are found to be in his hands, he is liable only to the amount of such assets. 3 Bac. Abr., Executors, (M).</p>\n<p>Estates by the law of Louisiana are administered under the special orders of the Probate Court. By the Code of Practice, Art. 984-988, no creditor is permitted to bring suit without first presenting his claim to the administrator. If the claim be admitted by the administrator in writing, it is filed among the acknowledged debts of the succession. If the claim be rejected, the creditor may bring suit. But a judgment gives no priority.</p>\n<p>By articles 1167, 1168, and 1169 of the Civil Code, the curator of a vacant succession can pay no debts, except privileged ones, until three months after the succession is opened, and then under the order of the judge. When the time for payment arrives, he must present his petition to the judge, with a statement of the debts due. And if the funds in his hands <span class=\"star-pagination\">*153</span> shall be insufficient to pay the debts in full, he is required to make a tableau of the distribution and present it to the judge, with a prayer that he should be authorized to make the payments accordingly. But if the administrator or curator \"neglect or refuse to file a tableau of the estate, and obtain the order of the judge to make payment, he can be compelled to do so on the demand of the interested, or in default thereof render himself responsible in his personal capacity.\" Kenner et al. v. Duncan's Executors, 3 Martin, N.S. 570.</p>\n<p>This last procedure is as indispensable under the Louisiana law to authorize a proceeding against the executor or administrator to make him personally responsible, as an action and judgment are necessary at common law to charge him with a devastavit. And it does not appear from the petition in the case before us, that any order of the judge was obtained as required, or that any proceedings were had to compel the defendant to exhibit a tableau of distribution, by which it would appear whether the executrix had assets in her hands to pay the whole or any part of the debt of the plaintiff. This action was commenced at law, and the fact is alleged that a large amount of assets came into the possession of the defendant which have been misapplied, on which ground a personal liability is sought to be enforced against her. This the law does not authorize. An executor or administrator by the laws of Louisiana is considered, in this respect, as a syndic of an insolvent estate. In 6 Martin, N.S. 126, the court say, when a syndic has been legally appointed, and has taken charge of the estate intrusted to him, no individual creditor can sue him for a debt or interfere with his administration. He may be ruled to produce his bank-book, file a tableau of distribution, &amp;c., but he should not be suffered to be harassed by suits brought by individual creditors, who allege or fear mismanagement on his part.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Order.</h2>\n<p>This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Louisiana, and was argued by counsel.

That no cause of action was shown in the petition; 2d. That no proper parties were made; and 3d. That the suit should have been upon the equity side of the court. But as the decision of this court turned exclusively upon the first point, that one only will be noticed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First. We think the petition shows good cause of action: no one disputes that an executor is responsible personally to some one for the value of the property received by him; either for its restoration in kind, or for its value, if the property or its value has been lost by his negligence whilst it remained in his possession. See 11 La. R. 22; 9 Rob. 405, 447; 9 La. R. 49; 3 Martin, N.

Civil Code, Art. 1627. And they are the parties principally interested in so much of the property as is needed to satisfy their claims; consequently, the account must be rendered to them of the property received, and payment must be made to them, if it is destroyed. No one else is interested in this matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, the plaintiff has set forth that the defendant received property worth $71,000, and that the debts were only $58,000; that she has destroyed a large amount of the notes, allegations, &amp;c., by permitting them to become prescribed and worthless; that she has converted to her own use properry worth $20,000, and that she has collected debts due to the estate of James Armour worth $50,000; that she has paid no one any thing, and that all this money, $71,000, was received as funds with which to pay plaintiff's debt, and that there is no other fund from which it can be paid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a tacit or <i>quasi</i> contract made by an executor in receiving property of a succession, that he will pay it to the parties to whom it rightfully belongs, that is, first to the creditors, then to the legatees, then to the heirs of the deceased. Plaintiff sets forth that this <i>quasi</i> contract has been violated so far as she is concerned, and she asks its enforcement; also, she says the defendant received property to the value of $71,000, which property was received by her to pay this very debt, and that by the negligence of the defendant it has partly become worthless, and that she has herself consumed and used the balance, and thus she has damaged the plaintiff to the whole amount of her debt. Thus she shows two good causes of action against the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The counsel for the appellee replied to this point as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1st.

Abr., tit. <i>Executors</i> (M.); Siglar <i>v.</i> Haywood, 8 Wheaton, 678.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no averment of judgment or execution in the petition. It is true that the plaintiff alleges that her name and debt were placed on a list of debts, and that on opposition it was adjudged 'that the estate of Armour owed petitioner the said sum of money.' But this is a very different thing from the judgment against an executor at common law. Such a judgment rendered simply is proof of assets; but a mere decree that the estate owed the debt is no judgment whatever against the executor, and no proof of assets on suit for devastavit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The proceeding to which the petition alludes is peculiar to the laws of Louisiana. No creditor is permitted to bring suit for the debt of the estate, without first presenting his claim to the administrator. If the claim be acknowledged in writing by the administrator, the creditor 'may present it to the judge, that it may be ranked amongst the acknowledged debts of the succession.' Louisiana Code of Practice, art. 984, 985. If the administrator refuse to acknowledge the claim, then the creditor may bring suit. Art. 986. But the judgment obtained gives no priority, and the creditor can only obtain payment concurrently with the other creditors. Art. 987. And when the administrator has funds to pay, he calls all the creditors together, to receive the amounts due them respectively. Art. 988.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge is empowered to direct the sale of property for payment of debts, and when the representative of the estate has funds, he calls the creditors together, by publications notifying them that a dividend has been declared, and a tableau thereof filed in court, in accordance with which the funds will be distributed after approval by the judge. In other words, estates are administered in Louisiana like bankruptcies. The executor is the assignee, and he makes payments or declares dividends only under the orders of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The acknowledgment of the executor is often made, as in this instance, by filing in court a list or statement of the debts of the succession. This list approved or homologated establishes the debt as against the succession, and entitles the creditor to participate in any future dividends. Such is the judgment of the plaintiff in this suit. How different it is from the judgment necessary at common law to support the action of devastavit, is too obvious to require any argument. It is different in its effects and its legal consequences. No execution can issue upon it, and it does not imply assets in the hands of the executor. Such a judgment is therefore insufficient to support the action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If it be pretended that the mode of proceeding in Louisiana precludes any other from of judgment, we reply that such is not the case. The rights of creditors are fully protected under our laws. If he has reason to believe that there are funds in the hands of the executor, he may call upon him by rule, and enforce its distribution. He may even demand the exhibition of his bank-books and accounts, to ascertain if he have funds. Act of 1837, Bullard &amp; Curry's Digest; Kenner <i>v.</i> Duncan's Executors, 3 Mart. N. S. 563.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such a distribution of funds in hand is a judgment in favor of each creditor for the dividend awarded to him. Morgan et al. <i>v.</i> Their Creditors, 4 La. R. 174; Nolte et al. <i>v.</i> Their Creditors, 7 Mart. N. S. 644; Preston <i>v.</i> Christin, 4 La. Ann. Rep. 102.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is, moreover, a judgment of assets to the amount of the dividend, and if after such a judgment the executor fail to pay, execution issues against him <i>de bonis propriis</i>. Code of Practice, Art. 994 and 1057.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is thus obvious that the laws of Louisiana do afford the same remedies as the common law against estates. If the petition contained an averment that a tableau of distribution had been filed and homologated, confessing the possession of assets, and awarding full payment to the plaintiff, then she would be in precisely the same position with a creditor having a common law judgment against an executor, and could maintain her action of devastavit. The petition contains no such allegation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reason of the rule applies to both systems equally. Under neither can the executor be vexed by personal pursuit, until it has been established judicially that payment cannot be obtained <i>de bonis testatoris</i>. Until that be ascertained, no personal action lies against the executor. All the cases cited in the printed brief of plaintiff's counsel support this view of the laws of Louisiana. The creditors and heirs may sue for an account, but no case can be cited in which such an action as the present has been sustained in this State, without showing a necessity for it, by proving that payment cannot be had from the goods of the succession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The position assumed in plaintiff's brief, that the executor is responsible to creditors for the property that comes into his hands, and for his fidelity in administration, is fully admitted, but it is denied that the courts of Louisiana will entertain a suit in the nature of a devastavit, without showing that the assets of the estate have been in some form exhausted. If the allegations of the petition be true, it is obvious that this suit is both unnecessary and vexatious. If property to the amount of over $70,000 in value has come to the hands of the defendant to pay debts of only $40,000, it is apparent that she is liable for the assets as executrix. She may be forced, under the heavy penalties imposed by law, on a breach of trust, to sell the property, collect the debts, and distribute the proceeds in the form prescribed by law. The plaintiff does not pretend that she has attempted to procure payment in that form. She alleges no rule against the defendant, no tableau of distribution confessing assets,&#8212;no step whatever against her in her representative capacity, taken ineffectually. It is idle to say that the executrix retains and appropriates to her own use the property and funds of the estate. If such property and funds be in her hands, she can hold them only under the control and supervision of the court. She is compelled by law and by the duties of her office to administer and distribute, and no proof can be received that she has not done so, except a judgment of the proper court. Such a judgment any creditor aggrieved may always provoke. The petition alleges no such judgment; the suit is therefore merely vexatious, and deserves no favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The point is expressly decided in a case in the Louisiana Reports, and we quote the opinion at length, to show that the principles above stated are fully recognized in Louisiana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'The plaintiff is appellant from a decree setting aside an order of sequestration which he had previously obtained. This order had been issued on his allegation that Tarbe and Nash had made a surrender of their property to their creditors, in the year 1837; that John Tarbe, one of the insolvents, had been appointed syndic of their creditors, and by the latter dispensed with giving security as such; that the defendant had illegally disposed of part of the property surrendered, by selling it at private sale, and that he was about to dispose of a quantity of other property belonging to the estate in the same illegal manner, to the prejudice of plaintiff and that of all the other creditors. We think that the court below did not err. The whole proceeding appears to us irregular and unwarranted by law. When a syndic has been legally appointed, and has taken charge of the estate intrusted to him, no individual creditor can sue him for a debt, or interfere with his administration. He may be ruled to produce his bank-book, file a tableau of distribution, and pay privileged debts, &amp;c., but he should not be suffered to be harassed by suits brought by individual creditors, who allege or fear mismanagement on his part. If he has been guilty of malfeasance or gross negligence, he can, in due course of law, be removed from office by the creditors, and made liable in damages in his individual capacity. 6 Martin, N.

She is a citizen of another State, and the federal courts are open to her. She might there have obtained judgment and issued execution against the executrix, and the return of the writ would have justified the present action. But she seeks to avoid compliance with the requisites of the law, and prefers to prosecute her suit without ascertaining by judicial proceedings that such a suit is either admissible or necessary. That she has chosen a course so irregular is significant of the want of foundation for her demand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice McLEAN delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A writ of error to the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Louisiana brings before us this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A suit was commenced by the plaintiff in the Circuit Court against the defendant, on a claim of debt amounting to the sum of $7,510, with interest, which James Armour, husband of the defendant, in his lifetime owed to the plaintiff. He died, having executed a will and made the defendant his executrix. She filed her petition in the Probate Court at New Orleans, and was duly authorized to act as executrix. At the decease of her husband, it is alleged, a large amount of property came into her hands as executrix, which she used for her own benefit, and neglected to pay the debts of the estate. And it averred that a misapplication of the funds has made the defendant liable in her individual capacity, and the plaintiff prays that she may be condemned to pay the above sum, &amp;c.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant demurs to the petition, on the ground that it is not sufficient in law to charge her, for want of parties, and that the matters are only cognizable in chancery. And she answers that she has fully administered, having made a full inventory of the property of said succession, and used all proper diligence to collect the debts, and disposed of the property in obedience to the order of the court; made reports of her acts, and presented a formal tableau of distribution, which was duly approved and homologated by the Probate Court.

The plaintiff demands a judgment <i>de bonis propriis</i>, against the defendant, no other step having been taken, or notice given, before the commencement of the present action. At common law an executor or administrator is not chargeable on a devastavit, until a judgment shall be obtained against him. He is bound to defend himself by legal pleading, and can have no relief in equity. If he suffer judgment by default, it is an admission of assets, and also if he file a plea in bar which he knows to be false. So if he pleads only the general issue, and has a verdict against him. If he plead <i>plene administravit</i>, and on this plea assets are found to be in his hands, he is liable only to the amount of such assets. 3 Bac. Abr., <i>Executors</i>, (M).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Estates by the law of Louisiana are administered under the special orders of the Probate Court. By the Code of Practice, Art. 984-988, no creditor is permitted to bring suit without first presenting his claim to the administrator. If the claim be admitted by the administrator in writing, it is filed among the acknowledged debts of the succession. If the claim be rejected, the creditor may bring suit. But a judgment gives no priority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By articles 1167, 1168, and 1169 of the Civil Code, the curator of a vacant succession can pay no debts, except privileged ones, until three months after the succession is opened, and then under the order of the judge. When the time for payment arrives, he must present his petition to the judge, with a statement of the debts due. And if the funds in his hands shall be insufficient to pay the debts in full, he is required to make a tableau of the distribution and present it to the judge, with a prayer that he should be authorized to make the payments accordingly. But if the administrator or curator 'neglect or refuse to file a tableau of the estate, and obtain the order of the judge to make payment, he can be compelled to do so on the demand of the interested, or in default thereof render himself responsible in his personal capacity.' Kenner et al. <i>v.</i> Duncan's Executors, 3 Martin, N. S. 570.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This last procedure is as indispensable under the Louisiana law to authorize a proceeding against the executor or administrator to make him personally responsible, as an action and judgment are necessary at common law to charge him with a devastavit. And it does not appear from the petition in the case before us, that any order of the judge was obtained as required, or that any proceedings were had to compel the defendant to exhibit a tableau of distribution, by which it would appear whether the executrix had assets in her hands to pay the whole or any part of the debt of the plaintiff. This action was commenced at law, and the fact is alleged that a large amount of assets came into the possession of the defendant which have been misapplied, on which ground a personal liability is sought to be enforced against her. This the law does not authorize. An executor or administrator by the laws of Louisiana is considered, in this respect, as a syndic of an insolvent estate. In 6 Martin, N. S. 126, the court say, when a syndic has been legally appointed, and has taken charge of the estate intrusted to him, no individual creditor can sue him for a debt or interfere with his administration. He may be ruled to produce his bank-book, file a tableau of distribution, &amp;c., but he should not be suffered to be harassed by suits brought by individual creditors, who allege or fear mismanagement on his part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\"><i>Order</i>.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Louisiana, and was argued by counsel.
