All the judges.</i></p>\n<p><i>All the Judges being present.</i></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*189</span> MARSHALL, <i>Ch. J.</i> delivered the opinion of the Court as follows:</p>\n<p>Much of the seeming intricacy of this cause will disappear, if we extricate the questions made by the pleadings before the Court, from others which might greatly embarrass and perplex it.</p>\n<p>The declaration contains four counts. The first recites an original contract between Cleon Moore and John Darby, for the sale of certain lands, lying in Kentucky, and proceeds to recount in detail those transactions on which the action was founded. The other counts state, in different terms, the several assumpsits, which they allege to have been made.</p>\n<p>The Defendants crave oyer of the written contract, stated in the first count, and file several pleas to that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*190</span> count. They then, without repeating the oyer, file similar pleas to the remaining counts. After taking issue on some of the pleas, and demurring to others, the Plaintiff below discontinues his first count:</p>\n<p>By the counsel for Hughes, this has been considered as error. But the Court can perceive no reason for this opinion. After this discontinuance, the parties are in precisely the same situation, as if all the issues both of law and fact which were joined upon that count, had been decided in favor of the Defendant below. Such decision could not, in point of law, have affected the rights of the parties under the issues joined on the remaining counts, and consequently the discontinuance upon that count must leave those rights unimpaired. Whether this count remain in the declaration, or be stricken out of it, the right of the Plaintiff in the Circuit Court, to recover on the other counts, will be precisely the same. The examination of this right must be conducted on the same principles as if the declaration had never contained the first count.</p>\n<p>By the Plaintiff in error it is contended, that the oyer, which was prayed of the written contract alleged in the first count, spreads that contract on the record, and makes it a part of all his subsequent pleas. This is certainly true with respect to all his subsequent pleas to that count, but not with respect to his pleas to the other counts. Different counts allege different contracts, and different assumpsits. It is upon this idea alone, that a verdict can be rendered for the Plaintiff, on one count, and for the Defendant on another. Now the oyer of one contract cannot be the oyer of another contract, and cannot spread upon the record a contract supposed to be totally distinct from that which was read. The discontinuance of the first count produces no change in this respect, in the condition of the parties. Had it remained, it could have had no influence on the other counts, nor could the oyer of the written contract it stated have transferred that contract to the other counts.</p>\n<p>The second count states, that Cleon Moore was owner and proprietor of a plat and certificate of survey for lands lying in Kentucky, for which he was entitled to a patent from the government of that State; and that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*191</span> James Hughes, without authority, transferred that plat and certificate, in the name of Cleon Moore to John Darby and the said Hughes, by which wrongful act a patent for the said land was issued to the said Darby &amp; Hughes to the great injury of the said Moore. That afterwards the said Hughes promised to pay to the said Moore, \"the sum of seven hundred pounds for the said injury, <i>and loss of the said land</i> assigned as aforesaid; the said Plaintiff at the same time, agreed to the said terms, and to accept of the said compensation in full of all claims and demands for the said <i>land</i> and for the injury aforesaid.\"</p>\n<p>To this count, the Defendant pleaded several pleas, one of which was, that neither the promise nor any memorandum thereof was made in writing. To this plea the Plaintiff demurred, and the Court sustained the demurrer.</p>\n<p>The correctness of this decision depends entirely on the application of the statute of frauds to the <i>contract</i> stated in the declaration.</p>\n<p>Cleon Moore is averred to have been the proprietor of a plat and certificate of survey on which Hughes &amp; Darby obtained a patent by using his name without authority. This tortious act did not divest Moore of his equitable title. The land, in equity, was his. Did he part with this title by the contract stated in the declaration? The answer must, in the opinion of the whole Court, be in the affirmative. \"He agreed to accept of the said compensation in full of all claims and demands for the said <i>land,</i> and for the injury aforesaid. This, then, was an <i>agreement</i> to sell his equitable title to the land for the sum of seven hundred pounds. The Court can perceive no distinction between the sale of land to which a man has only an equitable title, and a sale of land to which he has a legal title. They are equally within the statute.</p>\n<p>It is, therefore, the unanimous opinion of this Court, that the judgment upon the demurrer to this plea, ought to have been in favor of the Defendant below. This plea being a complete bar to the second count, it is unnecessary to consider the other pleas.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*192</span> The third count states the title of Cleon Moore, and the injury sustained by him to the same effect with the second count. It then states a conversation between the parties, \"concerning a compensation for the loss, \"and a liquidation of the damages sustained by the said \"Cleon, by reason of the misconduct and wrong doing \"of the said James in the premises, and of the vesting \"them, the said Darby &amp; Hughes, with the legal title to \"the said land as aforesaid; and it was then and there \"agreed by the said James, on his part, in consideration \"of the premises, and of the just claims of the said \"Cleon, for compensation and damages as aforesaid, \"that the said James should pay to the said Cleon, in \"satisfaction for the same, the sum of 700<i>l.</i>\" &amp;c. \"And \"the said Cleon then and there agreed, on his part, to \"accept of the said seven hundred pounds in full compensation \"of his just claims as aforesaid,\" and, upon the same being secured, &amp;c. to release and quit claim to the said James, all his, the said Cleon's, claims and demands whatsoever, for compensation, redress or damages arising from the wrong doing and misconduct of the said James in the premises, and from the vesting the said Darby &amp; Hughes, with the legal title to the said land as aforesaid.</p>\n<p>To this count also, the statute of frauds was pleaded in bar. The Plaintiff below demurred to the plea, and the Defendant joined in demurrer.</p>\n<p>Upon the true construction of the <i>contract</i> stated in this count, there was some contrariety of opinion among the judges. It is, however, the opinion, of the majority that the <i>contract</i> must be understood to import a <i>sale of land,</i> and that the sum of money stipulated to be paid, was, in contemplation of the parties, to <i>extinguish the title of the said Cleon Moore.</i></p>\n<p>The conversation was \"concerning a compensation \"for the loss and a liquidation of the damages sustained \"by the said Cleon,\" not only \"by reason of the misconduct \"of the said Hughes, but also by reason \"of \"the vesting them, the said Darby &amp; Hughes, with the \"legal title to the said land.\" \"And it was then \"agreed, in consideration of the just claims, of the said \"Cleon, for <i>compensation and damages,</i> that the said <span class=\"star-pagination\">*193</span> \"James, should pay the said Cleon, in satisfaction for \"the same, the sum of 700<i>l.</i>\" To the majority of the Court, it seems, that a compensation for the loss of the title to the land must be understood to be a compensation for the land itself, and that the receipt of this money by Cleon Moore, would not only have barred an action for damages, <i>but a suit in equity for the title.</i></p>\n<p>If this opinion be correct, then the <i>contract is substantially for the sale of land, and, to be valid, ought to have been in writing.</i> On this plea also the demurrer ought to have been overruled.</p>\n<p>The fourth count states the injury more in detail, than is done in either the second or third counts. It states the claim of Cleon Moore to be compensated for the loss sustained by his land being granted without his consent to Hughes and Darby. A conversation was then held, and \"propositions for a compromise were made, touching the compensation and indemnification of him, the said Cleon,\" \"and it was then and there agreed by the \"said James, in consideration of the just claims of the \"said Cleon, to be compensated for the damage and \"injury for the misconduct of the said James in the premises, \"and in consideration of the said James having \"procured and obtained a patent to be completed and \"issued to the said James, and the said John Darby, as \"last aforesaid, for the said land,\" that he, the said James, would well and truly pay the said Cleon, one other sum of 700<i>l.</i> This the \"said Cleon agreed to \"accept in satisfaction of his just claims to compensation \"arising from the causes and considerations last \"aforesaid.\"</p>\n<p>The compensation here offered and accepted, is for the injury sustained by Cleon Moore, in consequence of the grant of his land, by the state of Kentucky, to Hughes and Darby. It seems to the Court, that this compensation was in lieu of the patent itself, and must have been intended to <i>extinguish his right to that patent.</i> It is difficult to suppose an intention, in this case, to receive a full compensation for the loss of a title, and yet to retain the right to that title. The majority of the Court is of opinion that, under the <i>contract</i> as stated in this count also, the payment of the money agreed to be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*194</span> paid, would have <i>extinguished</i> the right of Cleon Moore to the land in question, and that this CONTRACT likewise is substantially a <i>contract</i> for the sale of land. The demurrer, therefore, to this plea ought to have been overruled.</p>\n<p>It is unnecessary to examine other points which were made in the cause. The judgment of the Circuit Court must be reversed, and judgment rendered for the Plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p><i>Judgment reversed.</i></p>\n</div>",

This was the real substantial defence in the cause.

By the act of assembly of Virginia, <i>p. p.</i> 15, which is like that of Kentucky, it is enacted that no action shall be brought, whereby to charge any person upon any contract, for the sale of lands, tenements, or hereditaments, unless the <i>promise or agreement</i> upon which such action shall be brought, or some memorandum or note thereof, shall be in writing, and signed by the party to be charged therewith, or some other person by him thereunto lawfully authorized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The contract set forth in each count of the declaration is a <i>contract for the sale of land</i>. It is a contract whereby the Plaintiff was to part with all his title to the land; and it is immaterial whether that title was legal or equitable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first count states expressly, that the Plaintiff '<i>promised to quit all claim to the tract of land</i>,' and the Defendant promised to pay 700<i>l</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 2d count also states, that the Defendant was to pay the 700<i>l.</i> as compensation for the injury and <i>loss of the land;</i> and the Plaintiff agreed to accept it '<i>in full of all</i> <i>claims and demands for the said land</i> and for the injury aforesaid.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 3d. count says, that a conversation was had concerning a <i>compensation for the loss</i>, and a liquidation of the damages, <i>sustained by the Plaintiff by reason</i> of the misconduct and wrong doing of the Defendant, and <i>of the vesting them, the said Darby and Hughes, with the legal title to the said land</i>, and it was agreed <i>in consideration of the premises</i>, that the Defendant should pay to the Plaintiff 700<i>l.</i> in full satisfaction of the Plaintiffs <i>claims as aforesaid</i>, and the Plaintiff agreed, upon such payment being made, to quit claim to the Defendant all the Plaintiffs claims <i>for compensation</i>, &amp;c. arising from the wrong doing and misconduct of the Defendant in the premises '<i>and from the vesting the said Darby and Hughes 'with the legal title to the said land</i>.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 4th count states that the Defendant agreed, in consideration of the just claims of the Plaintiff to be compensated for the damage and injury arising from the misconduct of the Defendant in the premises, and <i>in consideration of the Defendants having procured a patent to be issued to him and Darby for the land</i>, that he, the Defendant, would pay the Plaintiff another sum of 700<i>l</i>, &amp;c.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus the quit-claim of the Plaintiffs title to the land is the consideration of every promise in the declaration; and if the Plaintiff had no title, or if no title was to pass from the Plaintiff, by the contract, it was <i>nudum pactum</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. If this was not a contract for the sale of the Plaintiff's title to the land, a judgment for him in this suit could not have barred the Plaintiff from setting aside the patent in equity. There seems to have been an inconsistency in the opinions of the Court below. If the agreement extinguished the Plaintiffs equitable title, then it was an agreement for the sale of land, and ought to have been in writing. If it did not extinguish the Plaintiff's equitable title, then it could not bar him from setting aside the patent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JONES <i>and</i> C.

It was of itself an injury to the Plaintiff for which he was entitled to redress. It was actionable <i>per se.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But suppose that a judgment for the Plaintiff in this case should prevent him from setting aside the patent, yet it does not follow that it is a case within the statute of frauds. Contracts executed are not within that statute. If there be a verbal agreement for the sale of land, and the vendor executes his part of the agreement by conveying to the purchaser the legal title; which he accepts, and receives the possession and the title papers, it is not necessary that the vendor should have a promise in writing from the purchaser, in order to compel him to pay for it&#8212;a Court of Chancery would decree him to execute the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Plaintiffs subsequent ratification of the act of the Defendant, was equivolent to his previous assent. The contract then was executed on the part of Moore. The Defendant had all his title&#8212;and the possession&#8212;and the title papers. No further act was necessary on the part of the Plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Besides, it does not appear that the contract on the part of the Plaintiff, if there was any, for the transfer of his right, was not in writing. If it was necessary that it should have been in writing, it will, after verdict, be presumed to have been so. 1. <i>Chitty on pleadings</i>, 133. 1. <i>Sand.</i> 276 <i>(a.) note</i> 2. 4 <i>East.</i> 400.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the <i>Noli Prosequi</i>&#8212;the Plaintiff has a right to enter it at any time before verdict, and even after verdict, before judgment. <i>Sayer on damages</i>, 113. 12, <i>Mod.</i> 558.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Defendant could not by oyer of the agreement stated in the first count, make that agreement applicable to other counts which do not refer to it. The 3d and 4th pleas were only applicable to the first count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is immaterial whether the Plaintiff actually sustained damage to the value of 700<i>l.</i> It is sufficient if he sustained any damage at all. It is an action for liquidated damages, and it is immaterial what was the real injury which the Plaintiff suffered. 7 <i>Vin.</i> 300&#8212;<i>Tit Damages.

It was only an agreement for the extinguishment of an equitable right which need not be in writing. It transfered nothing to the Defendant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MARCH 7<i>th. All the Judges being present</i>,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MARSHALL, <i>Ch. J.</i> delivered the opinion of the Court as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Much of the seeming intricacy of this cause will disappear, if we extricate the questions made by the pleadings before the Court, from others which might greatly embarrass and perplex it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The declaration contains four counts. The first recites an original contract between Cleon Moore and John Darby, for the sale of certain lands, lying in Kentucky, and proceeds to recount in detail those transactions on which the action was founded. The other counts state, in different terms, the several assumpsits, which they allege to have been made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Defendants crave oyer of the written contract, stated in the first count, and file several pleas to that count. They then, without repeating the oyer, file similar pleas to the remaining counts. After taking issue on some of the pleas, and demurring to others, the Plaintiff below discontinues his first count:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the counsel for Hughes, this has been considered as error. But the Court can perceive no reason for this opinion. After this discontinuance, the parties are in precisely the same situation, as if all the issues both of law and fact which were joined upon that count, had been decided in favor of the Defendant below. Such decision could not, in point of law, have affected the rights of the parties under the issues joined on the remaining counts, and consequently the discontinuance upon that count must leave those rights unimpaired. Whether this count remain in the declaration, or be stricken out of it, the right of the Plaintiff in the Circuit Court, to recover on the other counts, will be precisely the same. The examination of this right must be conducted on the same principles as if the declaration had never contained the first count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the Plaintiff in error it is contended, that the oyer, which was prayed of the written contract alleged in the first count, spreads that contract on the record, and makes it a part of all his subsequent pleas. This is certainly true with respect to all his subsequent pleas to that count, but not with respect to his pleas to the other counts. Different counts allege different contracts, and different assumpsits. It is upon this idea alone, that a verdict can be rendered for the Plaintiff, on one count, and for the Defendant on another. Now the oyer of one contract cannot be the oyer of another contract, and cannot spread upon the record a contract supposed to be totally distinct from that which was read. The discontinuance of the first count produces no change in this respect, in the condition of the parties. Had it remained, it could have had no influence on the other counts, nor could the oyer of the written contract it stated have transferred that contract to the other counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second count states, that Cleon Moore was owner and proprietor of a plat and certificate of survey for lands lying in Kentucky, for which he was entitled to a patent from the government of that State; and that James Hughes, without authority, transferred that plat and certificate, in the name of Cleon Moore to John Darby and the said Hughes, by which wrongful act a patent for the said land was issued to the said Darby &amp; Hughes to the great injury of the said Moore. That afterwards the said Hughes promised to pay to the said Moore, 'the sum of seven hundred pounds for the said injury, <i>and loss of the said land</i> assigned as aforesaid; the said Plaintiff at the same time, agreed to the said terms, and to accept of the said compensation in full of all claims and demands for the said <i>land</i> and for the injury aforesaid.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To this count, the Defendant pleaded several pleas, one of which was, that neither the promise nor any memorandum thereof was made in writing. To this plea the Plaintiff demurred, and the Court sustained the demurrer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The correctness of this decision depends entirely on the application of the statute of frauds to the <i>contract</i> stated in the declaration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cleon Moore is averred to have been the proprietor of a plat and certificate of survey on which Hughes &amp; Darby obtained a patent by using his name without authority. This tortious act did not divest Moore of his equitable title. The land, in equity, was his. Did he part with this title by the contract stated in the declaration? The answer must, in the opinion of the whole Court, be in the affirmative. 'He agreed to accept of the said compensation in full of all claims and demands for the said <i>land</i>, and for the injury aforesaid. This, then, was an <i>agreement</i> to sell his equitable title to the land for the sum of seven hundred pounds. The Court can perceive no distinction between the sale of land to which a man has only an equitable title, and a sale, of land to which he has a legal title. They are equally within the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is, therefore, the unanimous opinion of this Court, that the judgment upon the demurrer to this plea, ought to have been in favor of the Defendant below. This plea being a complete bar to the second count, it is unnecessary to consider the other pleas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third count states the title of Cleon Moore, and the injury sustained by him to the same effect with the second count. It then states a conversation between the parties, 'concerning a compensation for the loss, and a liquidation of the damages sustained by the said Cleon, by reason of the misconduct and wrong doing of the said James in the premises, and of the vesting them, the said Darby &amp; Hughes, with the legal title to the said land as aforesaid; and it was then and there agreed by the said James, on his part, in consideration of the premises, and of the just claims of the said Cleon, for compensation and damages as aforesaid, that the said James should pay to the said Cleon, in satisfaction for the same, the sum of 700<i>l.</i>' &amp;c. 'And the said Cleon then and there agreed, on his part, to accept of the said seven hundred pounds in full compensation of his just claims as aforesaid,' and, upon the same being secured, &amp;c. to release and quit claim to the said James, all his, the said Cleon's, claims and demands whatsoever, for compensation, redress or damages arising from the wrong doing and misconduct of the said James in the premises, and from the vesting the said Darby &amp; Hughes, with the legal title to the said land as aforesaid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To this count also, the statute of frauds was pleaded in bar. The Plaintiff below demurred to the plea, and the Defendant joined in demurrer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon the true construction of the <i>contract</i> stated in this count, there was some contrariety of opinion among the judges. It is, however, the opinion, of the majority that the <i>contract</i> must be understood to import a <i>sale of land</i>, and that the sum of money stipulated to be paid, was, in contemplation of the parties, to <i>extinguish the title of the said Cleon Moore</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conversation was 'concerning a compensation for the loss and a liquidation of the damages sustained by the said Cleon,' not only 'by reason of the misconduct of the said Hughes, but also by reason 'of the vesting them, the said Darby &amp; Hughes, with the legal title to the said land.' 'And it was then agreed, in consideration of the just claims, of the said Cleon, for <i>compensation and damages</i>, that the said James, should pay the said Cleon, in satisfaction for the same, the sum of 700<i>l.</i>' To the majority of the Court, it seems, that a compensation for the loss of the title to the land must be understood to be a compensation for the land itself, and that the receipt of this money by Cleon Moore, would not only have barred an action for damages, <i>but a suit in equity for the title</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If this opinion be correct, then the <i>contract is substantially for the sale of land, and, to be valid, ought to have been in writing</i>. On this plea also the demurrer ought to have been overruled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fourth count states the injury more in detail, than is done in either the second or third counts. It states the claim of Cleon Moore to be compensated for the loss sustained by his land being granted without his consent to Hughes and Darby. A conversation was then held, and 'propositions for a compromise were made, touching the compensation and indemnification of him, the said Cleon,' 'and it was then and there agreed by the said James, in consideration of the just claims of the said Cleon, to be compensated for the damage and injury for the misconduct of the said James in the premises, and in consideration of the said James having procured and obtained a patent to be completed and issued to the said James, and the said John Darby, as last aforesaid, for the said land,' that he, the said James, would well and truly pay the said Cleon, one other sum of 700<i>l.</i> This the 'said Cleon agreed to accept in satisfaction of his just claims to compensation arising from the causes and considerations last aforesaid.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The compensation here offered and accepted, is for the injury sustained by Cleon Moore, in consequence of the grant of his land, by the state of Kentucky, to Hughes and Darby. It seems to the Court, that this compensation was in lieu of the patent itself, and must have been intended to <i>extinguish his right to that patent</i>. It is difficult to suppose an intention, in this case, to receive a full compensation for the loss of a title, and yet to retain the right to that title. The majority of the Court is of opinion that, under the <i>contract</i> as stated in this count also, the payment of the money agreed to be paid, would have <i>extinguished</i> the right of Cleon Moore to the land in question, and that this CONTRACT likewise is substantially a <i>contract</i> for the sale of land. The demurrer, therefore, to this plea ought to have been overruled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is unnecessary to examine other points which were made in the cause. The judgment of the Circuit Court must be reversed, and judgment rendered for the Plaintiff in error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Judgment reversed</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> It is understood that the opinion of the Court below was grounded on the idea that this case was to be governed by the principles relative to implied trusts which are not within the statute of frauds. Darby &amp; Hughes having obtained the legal estate without the assent of the Plaintiff, were to be considered as holding it in trust to secure to him the payment of 7001. in case the land should turn out to be worth 2,000l. This was an implied trust, resulting from the circumstances of the case, and which would cease to exist upon payment of the 700l. Upon the Plaintiff's receiving payment of that sum, his equitable title would cease. It would not be transferred to the Defendant; but would be extinguished. If the 700l. memtioned in the declaration were to be considered as the compensation for the injury done in depriving the Plaintiff of his legal security for 700l. to be paid upon a contingency, it is evident that that injury could not have exceeded 700l. And whether it were to be paid as compensation for that injury, or as the sum which would be due upon the happening of the contingency, it would equally destroy the implied trust. And as an implied trust can be raised without writing, so, it was thought, it could be extinguished without writing.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
