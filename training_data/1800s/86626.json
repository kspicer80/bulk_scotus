COHEN AND ELEAZER L. COHEN.</h1></center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center></center>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> The cause was argued by Mr. Reed and Mr. Clarkson, for the appellants, and Mr. Dallas and Mr. Budd, for the appellees.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> Mr. Justice WOODBURY delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>In this case, the plaintiffs in the court below, as children of Solomon and Beliah Cohen, and grandchildren of Joseph Simon, claimed an interest in certain lands which had been conveyed to Simon Gratz by Mrs. Phillips, the surviving executrix of Joseph Simon.</p>\n<p>That conveyance was alleged to have been fraudulent, and the plaintiffs prayed that it be set aside, and Simon Gratz be required to account for any sales and rents of the land. The court below decreed that the conveyance was void for fraud; vet, as the lands had been bought of Gratz since by innocent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> purchasers, declined to set it aside, but ordered the respondent to pay over the full value of the lands, and without any deduction for debts, advances, or expenses.</p>\n<p>This is an appeal from that decision; and in order to determine whether evidence enough exists to show that fraud was practised by either of the parties to the conveyance, as it is charged on both of them, it will be necessary to ascertain how the lands were situated, and the relation to them in which the grantor and grantee, as well as the plaintiffs, then stood.</p>\n<p>Some time prior to 1804, Joseph Simon and Michael Gratz purchased in partnership large tracts of land in Pennsylvania, the title deeds running to the former alone, under an agreement to account to the latter for half the proceeds. As sales of them were made from time to time, difficulties and litigation arose between them as to the proceeds, extending even to eight reported cases in the courts of Pennsylvania, and all of which appear to have been decided against Simon.</p>\n<p>He complained much that Gratz had obtained from him more than he was entitled to. Accordingly, when Simon made his will and died in 1804, he forbade, by the last codicil, any portion of his estate going to Michael Gratz or his wife Miriam, who was the daughter of Simon, and did not make either of them executors on his estate. But he appointed Levi Phillips and wife, the latter being another daughter, and Mrs. Cohen, a third daughter, executors. At first he bequeathed one third of the income of the residue of his estate to each daughter, but by the codicil increased Mrs. Phillips's and Mrs. Cohen's share each to one half of the principal, and, withdrawing Mrs. Gratz's share, empowered Levi Phillips to give to Mrs. Cohen the principal rather than the interest, or income. At the death of either daughter, her share was to vest in her children, as tenants in common. He gave to his executors, and the survivors of them, full power to sell his real, as well as personal estate.</p>\n<p>Some suits between Simon and Michael Gratz in relation to their partnership property were pending at the death of the former; others were soon after brought, and others still, as sales of the land were made by the executors, and recoveries were had in some of them for portions of what Simon and they had sold. By the death of Mr. Phillips in 1832, and of Mrs. Cohen in January, 1833, Mrs. Phillips had become the sole surviving executrix, and she in February, 1833, proposed to Simon Gratz, executor of Michael Gratz, to make a final settlement of the claims on his part against the estate of Joseph Simon. At that time, Simon Gratz held unsatisfied a judgment against Levi Phillips and Mrs. Cohen, which had been recovered in 1831 for $7,916.73.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> They had not been called \"Executors of Simon\" in the declaration, but the subject-matter of the action was connected with his estate, and with the proceeds of sales of the partnership lands.</p>\n<p>There was another action pending, which was brought by Gratz's Executors against Simon's Executors, in which an award had been made to Gratz for $2,967, but exceptions had been taken to it, not yet acted on.</p>\n<p>At that time, too, Mrs. Cohen had received from Simon's estate, as early as 1812, $1,008, which, with interest to 1833, amounted to near $6,500, and none of it had ever been refunded by her.</p>\n<p>In this state of things the inquiry arises, whether, in the proposals by Mrs. Phillips, the negotiation for a settlement, and the conveyance of the lands to Gratz under the conditions and circumstances of the case, fraud is manifest so as to justify the rescinding of that conveyance, or if not, because the land is now in the hands of innocent purchasers from Gratz, to make the latter account for its whole value as if the sale to him had been void. In deciding this question, let us look first to the terms and circumstances of the agreement.</p>\n<p>She stipulated, in relation to the suit then pending, to have the exceptions overruled, and the award confirmed for $2,967. She agreed further to discontinue a suit of doubtful merits pending by Simon's Executors against S. Gratz et al., Executors of Michael Gratz, and also as executrix to convey to S. Gratz all the unsold lands of the partnership, and all her own personal interest in Joseph Simon's estate. On the part of S. Gratz, he agreed to pay her $1,500 cash, \u0097 though nothing is said in the writing as to the release or discharge of the judgments against Joseph Simon's executors or other claims by S. Gratz; but they thus became virtually discharged, as all the remaining estate of Joseph Simon was then conveyed to S. Gratz. Nothing appears to have been said, likewise, as to the debt due from Mrs. Cohen, but probably that was deemed quite an equivalent to what remained of her share in Simon's estate; and she being dead, this was left as it had stood for twenty years.</p>\n<p>On these leading facts, the first ground assigned to show fraud by S. Gratz is a supposed deficiency of consideration for this agreement and the conveyance. But in the family settlement it is proper to look to equitable circumstances, and not to expect all such technical formalities as prevail between strangers. The consideration actually paid in money was $1,500, and though Mrs. Phillips may have regarded it as for her rather than the estate of Simon, yet it made little difference, as she was the only residuary devisee of Simon surviving; and if <span class=\"star-pagination\">*19</span> Mrs. Cohen had been already paid more than her share, as seems probable, this sum would virtually go to Mrs. Phillips alone, as it would first in form belong to the estate, and then to her as devisee. It was in fact also paid to her for matters connected with the estate, and while she was executrix of the estate, instead of being, as is argued, a personal bribe to her.</p>\n<p>Though a technical difference might exist between the executors as to their several liabilities (14 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 152), and though different modes of proceeding might be necessary to enforce them, yet the estate of Simon was the only fund liable. The interest in the partnership lands, which belonged to Michael Gratz, was the only source of all his claims, and the parties properly looked at it in its true equitable light, through all the varnish and varieties of form, and negotiated with a view to the whole.</p>\n<p>Thus, if one of these judgments did not describe the defendants as executors, yet the other did, and the first one was founded on the proceeds of sale by them as executors of lands, the title to which had stood in the name of Simon, though a moiety belonged to Michael Gratz, and the executors were acting in trust for Gratz as well as Simon. Now the $1,500 in money, and the $10,000 in the two judgments, with interest, were probably very near the value of the lands as situated in 1833. But to remove all doubt as to the fairness and fulness of the consideration, Simon Gratz further agreed to pay over to Mrs. Phillips any surplus the lands might yield after paying all reasonable expenses and legal claims. This cures every exception to the inadequacy of the consideration.</p>\n<p>If the surplus, after an inquiry into the matter, and after allowing to Michael Gratz or his estate and executors all which is just, should be considerable, an administrator of Mrs. Phillips could enforce its payment on this agreement; and the administrator of Mrs. Cohen, instead of being injured or defrauded, could obtain her share, and divide it among her children, the present complainants, if she had not before her death received enough to cover this, as well as former interests or dividends.</p>\n<p>It is next said in support of the alleged fraud, that Mrs. Phillips was an aged female, little accustomed to business, and likely to be overreached by so shrewd and capable a man as Simon Gratz. But Mrs. Phillips, though aged, is proved to have been intelligent and capable. She applied to him rather than he to her to make the settlement, and he suggested the advice and aid of her business friends rather than attempting a secret and sudden settlement. She did consult two intelligent business friends. Full time was given to make inquiries and calculations, rather than using haste. Though Mrs. Phillips <span class=\"star-pagination\">*20</span> did not confer with the plaintiffs, she was not bound to consult the Cohen heirs more than others; and the contract by Simon Gratz to pay over any surplus secured any eventual interest of theirs as fully as they themselves could have done, and wisely put an end to a protracted family litigation, as expensive and ruinous as it was derogatory.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Phillips, at her advanced age, being sole representative of Simon's estate, had a good and sufficient motive to be anxious, at the first opportunity after Mrs. Cohen's death, to close that estate up, and the lawsuits and the trusts, and was not likely to do it then, as assumed, because she could then more easily defraud. She could not then, by having the $1,500 paid to herself, deprive the plaintiffs, if she desired, of any share in it they might be entitled to. It was received on account of interests conveyed in the Simon estate.</p>\n<p>She was both executrix with a right to sell, and a devisee with a personal interest in the estate of Simon. What she received, then, of Simon Gratz, went to her in both capacities, it being proceeds of Joseph Simon's estate, and worked no injury to Mrs. Cohen's children, as Mrs. Phillips in her character of executrix would be liable to them for their share in what Gratz paid, if they had not already, through Mrs. Cohen, obtained enough to cover this.</p>\n<p>Too much importance has, in our view, been attached to the payment being to her, and not repeating the words \"as executrix,\" and the recovery of one judgment being against the other executors, without repeating their titles. These mere descriptions, inserted or omitted, cannot, however, in chancery, change the essence of a transaction, when they had nothing to receive, or grant, or account for, except as executors of Joseph Simon, and where the whole matters in controversy are connected with lands, the title of which was nominally in him, but the beneficiary interest in part in Michael Gratz and his executors.</p>\n<p>Again, it is urged against the validity of the conveyance, that it included some lands of Simon, in which Michael Gratz had no interest. But Mrs. Phillips, as surviving executrix, had a right under the will to sell any estate of Simon; and there was a good reason for selling the whole on this occasion, in order, at her advanced age, to close up the administration of Simon's estate, as well as to convey enough to Simon Gratz to satisfy his claims on it as executor.</p>\n<p>He, too, could manage it better than any female, and instead of taking advantage of her, or any body she represented, he became liable to account for any surplus, if any should occur.</p>\n<p>It is further urged, that the wishes of Joseph Simon to disinherit <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> Michael Gratz and his family were thus overcome, and are not to be trifled with.</p>\n<p>But the inflexible will of Joseph Simon against Michael Gratz and his family having any portion of his estate was not thwarted in this way, since they received nothing as devisees or heirs, but merely purchased for a valuable consideration what any person in the community had a right to buy, and obtained in the end chiefly land which S. Gratz's ancestor owned and paid for as much as J. Simon.</p>\n<p>In fine, we are at a loss to see any strong indications of fraud in any part of this transaction, either by S. Gratz or Mrs. Phillips; and most of what appears, at first, in some degree objectionable, seems reconciled with perfect integrity when we advert to the legal presumptions in favor of those charged with misbehavior, and to the family connection between the parties and the preponderating equities of the case.</p>\n<p>These conclusions would not be different, whether the principal of Mrs. Cohen's share was under the last codicil to be considered as vesting in her, or only the interest of it.</p>\n<p>Empowering an executor to make a change like that in a bequest is, however, usually regarded as expressing a wish to have it done, if it be not clearly a mere power, and to require that that be considered as done which ought to be done, if forgotten or omitted. Brown v. Higgs, 8 Ves. 574; 4 Wash. C.C. 278; 1 Story, Eq. \u00a7 98, and 2 Story, Eq. \u00a7 1068. Considering what are our views as to the validity of the conveyance, other points and exceptions in this case need not be examined, and especially that connected with the length of time which elapsed after the conveyance to S. Gratz, and before the filing of the present bill to avoid it.</p>\n<p>Let the judgment below be reversed, and the case sent back to have the bill dismissed, unless the present parties agree to let others in interest come in, and to reconstruct and alter the character of the bill by amendments, so as to carry the agreement between Mrs. Phillips and Gratz into effect, and pray for the surplus or balance, if any be found due from Gratz, after paying all he has advanced, and all his expenses, and his equitable as well as legal claims on Mrs. Phillips and the estate of Joseph Simon.</p>\n<p>Mr. Justice NELSON dissented.</p>\n<p>Mr. Justice GRIER did not sit on the trial of this cause, being indisposed at the time.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Order.</h2>\n<p>This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and was argued by counsel.

Cohen, citizens of the State of New Jersey, against Simon Gratz, Leah Phillips, and twelve other persons. It was a bill for a discovery against Leah Phillips, surviving executrix of Joseph Simon deceased, and Simon Gratz, and praying also that a certain agreement and deeds executed by and between said Leah and Simon might be annulled, and declared fraudulent and void, and that Simon Gratz be decreed to account, &amp;c.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bill involved the consideration of matters and accounts, commencing in 1769, and continuing down to the time when it was filed. It was a family dispute which had been carried on in the courts of Pennsylvania for a number of years, and reported as follows:&#8212;Gratz <i>v.</i> Phillips, 1 Binney, 588 (1809); Gratz <i>v.</i> Simon, 3 Binney, 474 (1811); Gratz <i>v.</i> Simon, 5 Binney, 564 (1813); Gratz <i>v.</i> Phillips, 14 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 144 (1827); Gratz <i>v.</i> Phillips et al., 1 Pa. Rep. 333 (1831); Gratz <i>v.</i> Phillips, 2 Pa. Rep. 410 (1831); Simon's Executors <i>v.</i> Gratz, 2 Pa.

Besides other children, whose interests were not involved in this controversy, he had three daughters, Miriam, Beliah, and Leah. They were all married. Miriam was married to Michael Gratz, Beliah to Solomon M. Cohen, and Leah to Levi Phillips. Simon Gratz, whose executors were the appellants, was one of the children of Miriam and Michael Gratz. The complainants below and appellees here, were the children of Beliah Cohen. At the time of Mr. Simon's death, there were unsettled partnership transactions between him and his son-in-law Michael Gratz, and a large body of lands was held by them in common. Suits were then pending between them relative to these transactions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the will of Joseph Simon, 26th October, 1799, he disposed of the bulk of his estate as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Art. 14. He ordered and directed that the whole residue of his estate (to be invested in certain stocks) should be divided into three equal shares, and one part of the proceeds thereof, that is the interest, should be paid to his daughter Miriam during her life; one third part of the proceeds or interest thereof to his son-in-law Levi Phillips and Leah his wife, during their joint lives and the life of the survivor of them; and the remaining third part to his daughter Beliah during her life.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the death of either daughter, her share of the principal to vest in her issue, to take as purchasers and tenants in common.

In a large number of these tracts of land, Michael Gratz was interested, by virtue of a declaration of trust given by Simon in his lifetime, and of claims of David Franks (a former partner of Simon), which had been transferred to Michael Gratz; Simon Gratz was the agent of Michael Gratz in his lifetime, and his chief acting administrator after his death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September, 1811, Michael Gratz died, and although letters of administration were granted to Simon in conjunction with other persons, yet he was the chief acting administrator, and appeared to transact all the business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not necessary to trace the progress of the various suits mentioned in the commencement of this narrative.

Cohen, their father, died in the month of February, 1796, and that Beliah Cohen, their mother, died on the 29th day of January, 1833, and that they, and their brothers and sisters heretofore named, are the persons mentioned as the children of his daughter Beliah in the last will and testament of Joseph Simon; that the papers of the estate of the said Joseph Simon were in the possession of Levi Phillips at the time of his death; that the said Levi Phillips died on the 15th day of January, 1832, and that after his death the papers of the said estate were in the possession of the said Leah Phillips, one of the executors of the said Joseph Simon; that during the year 1832, secret interviews took place between Simon Gratz and Leah Phillips, executrix, citizens of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, with the view of depriving your orators, and the other children of the said Beliah Cohen, of their just rights under the will of the said Joseph Simon, which said interviews were concealed from the said Beliah Cohen and her family; and your orators believe, and expressly charge, that John Moss, Isaac Phillips, Lyon J. Levy, and Isaac B. Phillips, citizens of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, were, during that year and afterwards, aiding and assisting the said Simon Gratz and Leah Phillips in their design to appropriate the estate of the said Joseph Simon to the said Simon Gratz and Leah Phillips, and deprive your orators, and their brothers and sisters, of the said estate and of their just rights. That shortly after the decease of their mother a fraudulent agreement was made and entered into between Simon Gratz and Leah Phillips, dated February 15th, 1833, a copy whereof, marked H, is hereto annexed, and which your orators pray may be taken as part of their bill; the object of which said agreement was fraudulently to terminate the suits then pending between the surviving executrix of the said Joseph Simon and the administrators of Michael Gratz, by agreeing, consenting to, and causing judgments to be taken against the estate of the said Joseph Simon, to the manifest injury of your orators, and their brothers and sisters hereinbefore named, interested as aforesaid in the said estate; and the further object, purpose, and intention of the said agreement was fraudulently to convey, or cause to be conveyed, to the said Simon Gratz all the real estate of the said Joseph Simon, which said real estate is more particularly set forth in a schedule hereto annexed, marked L, for a consideration entirely inadequate, and known so to be by the said Simon Gratz and Leah Phillips, and to transfer, without an adequate consideration, to the said Simon Gratz the debts due to the estate of the said Joseph Simon; and that the said Leah Phillips and Simon Gratz, then well knowing the unjust and fraudulent character of said agreement and the inadequacy of the consideration, did combine and confederate with others, their confederates, to defraud your orators, and their brothers and sisters, of their just interest in the estate of the said Joseph Simon. And your orators further show to your honors, that the said agreement was concealed from your orators and the other children of the said Beliah Cohen, and was first discovered by them on the 13th day of June, 1833, it having been produced on that day by Lyon J. Levy, one of the confederates, in an examination of the said Lyon J. Levy, as a witness before Michael W. Ash, Esquire, an alderman of the city of Philadelphia, the said Lyon J. Levy having been subpoenaed for the purpose of having his deposition taken in a case then pending in the Orphan's Court of Lancaster County; that the first knowledge your orators, and, as they verily believe, any of the children of the said Beliah Cohen, had of an arrangement having been made between Simon Gratz and Leah Phillips, was obtained by one of their brothers, Joseph S. Cohen, who, on the 23d day of March, 1833, was informed by Benjamin Champneys, Esquire, who had been and was counsel for the estate of Joseph Simon, that he, the said Benjamin Champneys, had received from Leah Phillips a power or warrant of attorney to enter judgment for the plaintiffs in a suit then pending, and on the argument list of the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County, between Gratz's Administrators, plaintiffs, and Simon's Executors, defendants, the copy of the record whereof is hereunto annexed. That the said Benjamin Champneys refused to show the said power or warrant to the said Joseph S. Cohen; that on the morning of the 25th of March, 1833, the day fixed for hearing arguments in the said Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County, the said Joseph S. Cohen attended with his counsel, James Hopkins, Esquire, and Reah Frazer, Esquire, at the opening of the court, and filed the affidavit, a copy whereof, marked I, is hereto annexed; and on motion of Mr. Hopkins, the said court, after considerable resistance on the part of John R. Montgomery and William Morris, Esquires, counsel of Simon Gratz, granted a rule to show cause why Sarah M. Cohen and others, children of the said Beliah Cohen, and interested in the estate of the said Joseph Simon, should not be permitted to come in and take defence in the said action, as appears by the said rule, a copy whereof is hereto annexed, marked J, which raid rule was duly served on the said Leah Phillips, surviving executrix.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Your orators further show to your honors, that in pursuance of the said fraudulent and secret agreement, dated the 15th day of February, 1833, entered into between the said Leah Phillips and Simon Gratz at the instance of the said John Moss, Lyon J. Levy, and others, their confederates, who, when discovered, your orators pray may be made parties to this their bill, with apt and sufficient words to charge them; the said Leah Phillips, surviving executrix as aforesaid, afterwards delivered to the said Lyon J.

Levy, to make a settlement of long pending controversies between the estate of Joseph Simon, of which she was the surviving representative, and of Michael Gratz, which she believed to be represented by the said Simon Gratz, and also to make sale of such lands vested in her under the will of said Joseph Simon as the said Simon Gratz might be willing to purchase. The defendant says, that her object in proposing the arrangement was to terminate controversies which she was unwilling and unable to carry on, and to obtain such a sum of money as would relieve her from embarrassment, which gave her great uneasiness; the said defendant then and still believes, that in making this arrangement she prejudiced the rights of no one, but did what the law gave her perfect authority to do; and this defendant answering says, that in the month of October, 1832, she addressed several notes to said Simon Gratz, desiring to confer with him on the proposed arrangement and purchase, and that she had several interviews with him at her own house, and at his counting-house, and that she entered into an agreement with him, the said Simon Gratz, in order to terminate the pending suits above referred to, and made a conveyance of certain lands to the said Simon Gratz, receiving therefor the sum of fifteen hundred dollars, which was duly paid on and after the execution of the said conveyance and agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'And this defendant further answering saith, that, with a view to carry such conveyance into full effect, she deposited with Lyon J.

Reference was made to a master to state an account, &amp;c. Exceptions were taken to the report of the master, some of which were sustained and others overruled. The final decree of the court was as follows:&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'That the said Louisa Gratz, Edward Gratz, David Gratz, and Isaac Prince, executors of the last will and testament of Simon Gratz, deceased, do account and pay to Samuel M.

There is no such evidence of fraud on the part either of the executrix, Mrs. Phillips, in making the sale of the lands, or of Mr. Gratz in purchasing, as will authorize the rescission of the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">II. The appellees, children of Mrs. Cohen, are in no way injured by the agreement between Mr. Gratz and Mrs. Phillips, their interest either as heirs of their mother, or under the will of Mr. Simon, being more than absorbed by the judgment of $7,916, and the debt of Mrs. Cohen ($6,500) as executrix to her father's estate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">III. That Beliah Cohen, under the last codicil to Joseph Simon's will, took an absolute estate, and not an estate for life, and Levi Phillips was a trustee for her. Such is the plain meaning of the words of the codicil. 'A power which, by the will, the party is required to execute as a duty, makes him a trustee for the exercise of it, and allows no discretion whether he will exercise it or not. The court adopts the principle as to trusts, and will not permit his negligence, accident, or other circumstances to disappoint the interest of those for whose benefit he is to execute it.' Brown <i>v.</i> Higgs, 8 Ves. 574; 1 Story's Equity, &#167; 98; 2 Ib. &#167; 1068; Lindenberger <i>v.</i> Matlack, 4 Wash. C. C. R. 278; Coates's Appeal, 2 Barr, Penn. State Rep. 129. If Beliah Cohen had an absolute estate, then debts and judgments against her bound it, and the learned judge erred in saying that was a misapplication of trust funds. It was an application of funds not belonging to Beliah Cohen's children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IV. The proceeds of the lands which the appellees seek to recover, if they exceeded the amount of the judgment referred to in the acts to be performed, are liable to a claim on the part of the representatives of Mrs. Phillips, if to any body. The appellees do not claim under her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V. This is a stale demand for the interference of a court of equity, which will not be favored. In 1833, when this alleged fraud was discovered, and the plaintiffs below sought redress in the State courts, Simon Gratz, the only individual acquainted with the details of these perplexed transactions, was in full life and vigor. In 1839, when the bill was filed, he was on his death-bed, and died in July, 1839. For five years and eleven months the plaintiffs slept on their rights. In a month the statute of Pennsylvania would have barred the claim by express limitation. Where an application is made for the interposition of this court, and there has been laches, it is not necessary that the actual limitation fixed by the statute should apply. This is well settled. Cholmondeley <i>v.</i> Clinton, 2 Jac. &amp; Walk. 141: 'At all times courts of equity have, upon general principles of their own, even where there was no statutable bar, refused relief to stale demands where the party has slept upon his rights'; cited with approval, Miller <i>v.</i> M'Intyre, 6 Peters, 66. It is a simple question, says Judge McLean, 'Has the party slept on his rights?' Coalson <i>v.</i> Walton, 9 Peters, 83.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The doctrine that lapse of time may be used as a defence in equity, is far more favored than formerly. When the party is dead, probably his clerks and agents also dead, there being no one who can give any explanation of a paper, or show how it was prepared, and under what circumstances, this doctrine is especially favored. White <i>v.</i> Parnther, 1 Knapp (Privy Council), 226.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a most important element where a party sought to be affected has been allowed to die, and executors are made parties who have no knowledge of the original transaction. Ellison <i>v.</i> Moffat, 1 Johns. Ch. 47.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This doctrine is applicable to cases where fraud is charged; Prescott <i>v.</i> Hubbell, 1 Hill, Ch. 213; and this where the party charged is considered, as in this case, a trustee by operation of law, though it might not be as between a direct trustee and his <i>cestui que trust</i>. Decouche <i>v.</i> Savetier, 3 Johns. Ch. 190. Where a party is chargeable with laches to the extent of the statute of limitations, he must state in his bill that the discovery of the fraud was within the limitation. 1 Hill, Ch. 214.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Carr <i>v.</i> Chapman, 5 Leigh, 185, Lord Camden's doctrine in Smith <i>v.</i> Clay, 3 Bro. Ch. 640, was cited with approval: 'Nothing can call this court into action but conscience, good faith, and reasonable diligence; when this is wanting, this court is always passive'; and it is on these principles courts of equity, though they have adopted, are not tied down by, statutes of limitation. A shorter period of time, accompanied by gross negligence and acts of abandonment by those having an interest and competent to assert their rights, will bring their case within Lord Camden's principles. If the court saw that it was called on to do injustice, it would not move, however strong in point of original right the claim might be. So in Wagner <i>v.</i> Baird, 7 Howard, 234; and Bowman <i>v.</i> Wathen, 1 Howard, 189.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In McKnight <i>v.</i> Taylor, 1 Howard, 168, the statute of limitations was, as here, within a few months of coming into operation, yet plaintiffs were concluded by laches; there must be reasonable diligence to call into action the power of this court. There is difficulty which the law recognizes in doing justice, when the original transaction has become obscure and evidence may be lost.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the same effect are Piatt <i>v.</i> Vattier, 9 Peters, 416, and Philips <i>v.</i> Belden, 2 Edw. 1. Equity gives effect to relatively short lapse of time, discouraging claims not promptly made, especially where there is no personal disability or other impediment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No court has been more emphatic in its language favoring lapse of time than this court. Prevost <i>v.</i> Gratz, 6 Wheaton, 481: 'Length of time necessarily obscures all human evidence, and it thus removes from the parties all immediate means to verify the nature of the original transaction; it operates by way of presumption in favor of innocence and against any imputation of fraud. Fraud or breach of trust ought not to be lightly imputed to the living, for the legal presumption is the other way; and as to the dead, who are not here to answer for themselves, it would be the height of injustice and cruelty to disturb their ashes and violate the sanctity of the grave, unless the evidence be clear beyond a reasonable doubt.' Also to the same effect, and that laches or lapse of time may be resorted to as a defence on the evidence without being pleaded, Giles <i>v.</i> Baremore, 5 Johns. Ch. 550; Baker <i>v.</i> Biddle, 1 Baldwin, 417.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the general doctrine as to stale demands in equity, and the effect of parties not promptly asserting their rights, see Salsbury <i>v.</i> Bagott, 2 Swanst. 613; Beckford <i>v.</i> Wade, 17 Ves. 97; Andrew <i>v.</i> Wrigley, 4 Bro. Ch. 125; Brown <i>v.</i> Deloraine, 3 Bro. Ch. 639; Hovenden <i>v.</i> Annesley, 2 Sch. &amp; Lef. 629; Hercy <i>v.</i> Dinwoody, 4 Bro. Ch. 268; Wych <i>v.</i> East India Co., 3 P. Wms. 309; Pickering <i>v.</i> Lord Stamford, 2 Ves. 582; Christophers <i>v.</i> Sparke, 2 Jac. &amp; Walk. 223.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a rule, the statute of limitations does not operate in cases of trust or fraud, but as soon as fraud is discovered it begins to rise. Wamberzee <i>v.</i> Kennedy, 4 Desaus. 479.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Veazie <i>v.</i> Williams, 3 Story, 629, there were five years and a half between the sale alleged to be fraudulent and the filing of the bill to avoid it, and the court held the lapse of time to be a bar, because by time the evidence as to the original transaction had been obscured. A court of equity should never be active in granting relief where the circumstances are of such a nature as that it may become the instrument of as much injustice as it seeks to redress. To the same effect, Gould <i>v.</i> Gould, 3 Story, 516.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circumstances from which the laches in this case are deduced are very flagrant. Five years and eleven months were allowed to elapse after the discovery of the alleged fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the judgment of $7,916, in favor of Gratz's Administrators <i>v.</i> Simon's Executors, was a lien on the real estate, the Cohens waited till that lien had expired, which it did in five years, or 1838. They never charged a fraud whilst Simon Gratz was in life and health.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first allegation of the plaintiffs is in J. S. Cohen's affidavit at Lancaster, 25th March, 1833, within a month of the date of the agreement. In this there is no averment of fraud in either Leah Phillips or Simon Gratz. The most is an implication of such fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the letter of the Cohen family to the administrator of Michael Gratz, dated 29th March, 1833, the same guarded and doubtful phraseology is used, but there is no averment of fraud. So in the affidavit of 8th April, 1833.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the affidavit of J. S. Cohen, of 29th July, 1833, no fraud is charged, the strongest word being 'collusion.'No averment of fraud was made till this bill was filed in January, 1839; and then, as above stated, Simon Gratz was ill, and he died before his answer could be prepared. It will be remembered that the insinuations of collusion in these affidavits were promptly met by counter-affidavits from Leah Phillips, to which, as well as to her answer, the court are particularly referred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of this gross laches of nearly six years, the learned judge took no other notice than in saying, that it was to be lamented that Mr. Gratz died before his answer was prepared. In this omission it is submitted that he erred. The deposition of Mr. Gratz is no equivalent to an answer to the various and specific allegations of the plaintiffs' bill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had the plaintiffs interposed at once on the discovery of the imputed fraud, or at any time short of six years, or for five years and eleven months, the lands would not have been sold. The plaintiffs lay by till the lien of the judgment was gone, and the lands disposed of at great trouble and by great effort, for it is manifest that nothing but the greatest exertion and constant supervision by Mr. Gratz and his agents could have disposed of them to even moderate advantage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument of the counsel for the appellees consisted chiefly in an examination of the evidence, to show that the decree of the Circuit Court was correct. A great part of this testimony has been necessarily omitted in the statement of the case, and the argument drawn from it cannot therefore be condensed. The authorities cited by the counsel were the following.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Simon Gratz was not a <i>bon a fide</i> purchaser without notice of his grantor's breach of trust, and his representatives were rightfully decreed by the court to be trustees for the benefit of the Cohens, and charged with the value of the lands so wrongfully obtained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Courts of equity will decree a trust <i>in invitum</i> against a party who purchases trust property in violation of the objects of the trust, and will force the trust upon the conscience of the guilty party, and compel him to hold the property subject to it in the same manner as the trustees held it.' 1 Story's Equity, 395-405.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scott <i>v.</i> Tyler, 2 Dickens, 725: 'If one concerts with an executor or legatees, by obtaining the testator's effects at a nominal price, or at a fraudulent undervalue, or by applying the real estate to the purchase of other subjects for his own behoof, or in extinguishing the private debt of the executor, or in any other manner, contrary to the duty of the office of the executor, such concert will involve the seeming purchaser, or his pawnee, and make him liable for the full value.' 2 Story's Equity, &#167; 1257.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hill <i>v.</i> Simpson, 7 Ves. jr. 152: 'Transfer by an executor, a clear misapplication of assets immediately after the death, to secure a debt of the executor and future advances, under circumstances of gross negligence, though not direct fraud, set aside by general legatees.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">M'Leod <i>v.</i> Drummond, 17 Ves. jr. 169.

A comparison between the facts of this case and those of the decisions referred to, will show that the lapse of time which prevented the interposition of courts of equity far exceeded that which is here the ground of complaint, and did not admit of the explanations which excuse the comparatively brief delay in the complainants in seeking a redress for their wrongs in a federal court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An examination of the following leading cases, cited by the appellants, will show what the courts have considered as stale claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Prevost <i>v.</i> Gratz, 6 Wheat. 481, it was determined that the lapse of forty years, and the death of all the original parties, was sufficient to presume the discharge and extinguishment of a trust proved once to have existed by strong circumstances.

The court below decreed that the conveyance was void for fraud; vet, as the lands had been bought of Gratz since by innocent purchasers, declined to set it aside, but ordered the respondent to pay over the full value of the lands, and without any deduction for debts, advances, or expenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is an appeal from that decision; and in order to determine whether evidence enough exists to show that fraud was practised by either of the parties to the conveyance, as it is charged on both of them, it will be necessary to ascertain how the lands were situated, and the relation to them in which the grantor and grantee, as well as the plaintiffs, then stood.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some time prior to 1804, Joseph Simon and Michael Gratz purchased in partnership large tracts of land in Pennsylvania, the title deeds running to the former alone, under an agreement to account to the latter for half the proceeds. As sales of them were made from time to time, difficulties and litigation arose between them as to the proceeds, extending even to eight reported cases in the courts of Pennsylvania, and all of which appear to have been decided against Simon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He complained much that Gratz had obtained from min more than he was entitled to. Accordingly, when Simon made his will and died in 1804, he forbade, by the last codicil, any portion of his estate going to Michael Gratz or his wife Miriam, who was the daughter of Simon, and did not make either of them executors on his estate. But he appointed Levi Phillips and wife, the latter being another daughter, and Mrs. Cohen, a third daughter, executors. At first he bequeathed one third of the income of the residue of his estate to each daughter, but by the codicil increased Mrs. Phillips's and Mrs. Cohen's share each to one half of the principal, and, withdrawing Mrs. Gratz's share, empowered Levi Phillips to give to Mrs. Cohen the principal rather than the interest, or income. At the death of either daughter, her share was to vest in her children, as tenants in common. He gave to his executors, and the survivors of them, full power to sell his real, as well as personal estate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some suits between Simon and Michael Gratz in relation to their partnership property were pending at the death of the former; others were soon after brought, and others still, as sales of the land were made by the executors, and recoveries were had in some of them for portions of what Simon and they had sold. By the death of Mr. Phillips in 1832, and of Mrs. Cohen in January, 1833, Mrs. Phillips had become the sole surviving executrix, and she in February, 1833, proposed to Simon Gratz, executor of Michael Gratz, to make a final settlement of the claims on his part against the estate of Joseph Simon. At that time, Simon Gratz held unsatisfied a judgment against Levi Phillips and Mrs. Cohen, which had been recovered in 1831 for $7,916.73.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">They had not been called 'Executors of Simon' in the declaration, but the subject-matter of the action was connected with his estate, and with the proceeds of sales of the partnership lands.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was another action pending, which was brought by Gratz's Executors against Simon's Executors, in which an award had been made to Gratz for $2,967, but exceptions had been taken to it, not yet acted on.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At that time, too, Mrs. Cohen had received from Simon's estate, as early as 1812, $1,008, which, with interest to 1833, amounted to near $6,500, and none of it had ever been refunded by her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this state of things the inquiry arises, whether, in the proposals by Mrs. Phillips, the negotiation for a settlement, and the conveyance of the lands to Gratz under the conditions and circumstances of the case, fraud is manifest so as to justify the rescinding of that conveyance, or if not, because the land is now in the hands of innocent purchasers from Gratz, to make the latter account for its whole value as if the sale to him had been void. In deciding this question, let us look first to the terms and circumstances of the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">She stipulated, in relation to the suit then pending, to have the exceptions overruled, and the award confirmed for $2,967. She agreed further to discontinue a suit of doubtful merits pending by Simon's Executors against S. Gratz et al., Executors of Michael Gratz, and also as executrix to convey to S. Gratz all the unsold lands of the partnership, and all her own personal interest in Joseph Simon's estate. On the part of S. Gratz, he agreed to pay her $1,500 cash,&#8212;though nothing is said in the writing as to the release or discharge of the judgments against Joseph Simon's executors or other claims by S. Gratz; but they thus became virtually discharged, as all the remaining estate of Joseph Simon was then conveyed to S. Gratz. Nothing appears to have been said, likewise, as to the debt due from Mrs. Cohen, but probably that was deemed quite an equivalent to what remained of her share in Simon's estate; and she being dead, this was left as it had stood for twenty years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On these leading facts, the first ground assigned to show fraud by S. Gratz is a supposed deficiency of consideration for this agreement and the conveyance. But in the family settlement it is proper to look to equitable circumstances, and not to expect all such technical formalities as prevail between strangers. The consideration actually paid in money was $1,500, and though Mrs. Phillips may have regarded it as for her rather than the estate of Simon, yet it made little difference, as she was the only residuary devisee of Simon surviving; and if Mrs. Cohen had been already paid more than her share, as seems probable, this sum would virtually go to Mrs. Phillips alone, as it would first in form belong to the estate, and then to her as devisee. It was in fact also paid to her for matters connected with the estate, and while she was executrix of the estate, instead of being, as is argued, a personal bribe to her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though a technical difference might exist between the executors as to their several liabilities (14 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 152), and though different modes of proceeding might be necessary to enforce them, yet the estate of Simon was the only fund liable. The interest in the partnership lands, which belonged to Michael Gratz, was the only source of all his claims, and the parties properly looked at it in its true equitable light, through all the varnish and varieties of form, and negotiated with a view to the whole.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, if one of these judgments did not describe the defendants as executors, yet the other did, and the first one was founded on the proceeds of sale by them as executors of lands, the title to which had stood in the name of Simon, though a moiety belonged to Michael Gratz, and the executors were acting in trust for Gratz as well as Simon. Now the $1,500 in money, and the $10,000 in the two judgments, with interest, were probably very near the value of the lands as situated in 1833. But to remove all doubt as to the fairness and fulness of the consideration, Simon Gratz further agreed to pay over to Mrs. Phillips any surplus the lands might yield after paying all reasonable expenses and legal claims. This cures every exception to the inadequacy of the consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the surplus, after an inquiry into the matter, and after allowing to Michael Gratz or his estate and executors all which is just, should be considerable, an administrator of Mrs. Phillips could enforce its payment on this agreement; and the administrator of Mrs. Cohen, instead of being injured or defrauded, could obtain her share, and divide it among her children, the present complainants, if she had not before her death received enough to cover this, as well as former interests or dividends.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is next said in support of the alleged fraud, that Mrs. Phillips was an aged female, little accustomed to business, and likely to be overreached by so shrewd and capable a man as Simon Gratz. But Mrs. Phillips, though aged, is proved to have been intelligent and capable. She applied to him rather than he to her to make the settlement, and he suggested the advice and aid of her business friends rather than attempting a secret and sudden settlement. She did consult two intelligent business friends. Full time was given to make inquiries and calculations, rather than using haste. Though Mrs. Phillips did not confer with the plaintiffs, she was not bound to consult the Cohen heirs more than others; and the contract by Simon Gratz to pay over any surplus secured any eventual interest of theirs as fully as they themselves could have done, and wisely put an end to a protracted family litigation, as expensive and ruinous as it was derogatory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mrs. Phillips, at her advanced age, being sole representative of Simon's estate, had a good and sufficient motive to be anxious, at the first opportunity after Mrs. Cohen's death, to close that estate up, and the lawsuits and the trusts, and was not likely to do it then, as assumed, because she could then more easily defraud. She could not then, by having the $1,500 paid to herself, deprive the plaintiffs, if she desired, of any share in it they might be entitled to. It was received on account of interests conveyed in the Simon estate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">She was both executrix with a right to sell, and a devisee with a personal interest in the estate of Simon. What she received, then, of Simon Gratz, went to her in both capacities, it being proceeds of Joseph Simon's estate, and worked no injury to Mrs. Cohen's children, as Mrs. Phillips in her character of executrix would be liable to them for their share in what Gratz paid, if they had not already, through Mrs. Cohen, obtained enough to cover this.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Too much importance has, in our view, been attached to the payment being to her, and not repeating the words '<i>as executrix</i>,' and the recovery of one judgment being against the other executors, without repeating their titles. These mere descriptions, inserted or omitted, cannot, however, in chancery, change the essence of a transaction, when they had nothing to receive, or grant, or account for, except as executors of Joseph Simon, and where the whole matters in controversy are connected with lands, the title of which was nominally in him, but the beneficiary interest in part in Michael Gratz and his executors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, it is urged against the validity of the conveyance, that it included some lands of Simon, in which Michael Gratz had no interest. But Mrs. Phillips, as surviving executrix, had a right under the will to sell any estate of Simon; and there was a good reason for selling the whole on this occasion, in order, at her advanced age, to close up the administration of Simon's estate, as well as to convey enough to Simon Gratz to satisfy his claims on it as executor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He, too, could manage it better than any female, and instead of taking advantage of her, or any body she represented, he became liable to account for any surplus, if any should occur.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is further urged, that the wishes of Joseph Simon to disinheritMichael Gratz and his family were thus overcome, and are not to be trifled with.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the inflexible will of Joseph Simon against Michael Gratz and his family having any portion of his estate was not thwarted in this way, since they received nothing as devisees or heirs, but merely purchased for a valuable consideration what any person in the community had a right to buy, and obtained in the end chiefly land which S. Gratz's ancestor owned and paid for as much as J. Simon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fine, we are at a loss to see any strong indications of fraud in any part of this transaction, either by S. Gratz or Mrs. Phillips; and most of what appears, at first, in some degree objectionable, seems reconciled with perfect integrity when we advert to the legal presumptions in favor of those charged with misbehavior, and to the family connection between the parties and the preponderating equities of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These conclusions would not be different, whether the principal of Mrs. Cohen's share was under the last codicil to be considered as vesting in her, or only the interest of it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Empowering an executor to make a change like that in a bequest is, however, usually regarded as expressing a wish to have it done, if it be not clearly a mere power, and to require that that be considered as done which ought to be done, if forgotten or omitted. Brown <i>v.</i> Higgs, 8 Ves. 574; 4 Wash. C. C. 278; 1 Story, Eq. &#167; 98, and 2 Story, Eq. &#167; 1068. Considering what are our views as to the validity of the conveyance, other points and exceptions in this case need not be examined, and especially that connected with the length of time which elapsed after the conveyance to S. Gratz, and before the filing of the present bill to avoid it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let the judgment below be reversed, and the case sent back to have the bill dismissed, unless the present parties agree to let others in interest come in, and to reconstruct and alter the character of the bill by amendments, so as to carry the agreement between Mrs. Phillips and Gratz into effect, and pray for the surplus or balance, if any be found due from Gratz, after paying all he has advanced, and all his expenses, and his equitable as well as legal claims on Mrs. Phillips and the estate of Joseph Simon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice NELSON dissented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice GRIER did not sit on the trial of this cause, being indisposed at the time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\"><i>Order</i>.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and was argued by counsel.
