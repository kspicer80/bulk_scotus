Gill, had obtained judgment against him in the same court for $450. It charged, that on the 15th of July, 1857, Brown was engaged in mercantile pursuits in the city of Omaha; that he was on that day utterly insolvent, and being about to suspend business and the payment of his debts, purchased certain real estate in the city just named; and in order to place it beyond the reach of his creditors, procured a conveyance to be made to the other defendant, Jones, who it was alleged now held the property upon a secret trust for <i>him</i>. The bill set forth also that executions had been issued and returned unsatisfied, and prayed that the premises might be sold and the proceeds applied to the payment of the judgments. <i>The</i> <i>answer denied that executions had been issued and returned unsatisfied; and there was no sufficient proof that they had been</i>.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court rendered a decree in favor of the complainants, and the Supreme Court of the Territory affirmed it.
