The writ of error was too late to be a <i>supersedeas</i> to the decree.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">JONES, <i>for the Plaintiff in error</i>, now moved to quash the writ of <i>habere facias</i> as irregular, and contended that the Court below, sitting as a Court of Chancery, under the laws of Tennessee, could only enforce by execution decrees<i>for the payment of money</i>, and cited <i>Tennessee Laws, Ed.</i> 1807, p. 158. &#167; 2.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P. B. KEY, <i>contra</i>. This Court has no jurisdiction to quash an execution issued from the Court below, <i>and executed</i>. But if this Court had the power to do it, it would not in its discretion quash a process which has merely carried into effect the decree of the Court below. If the <i>decree</i> be reversed upon the merits, the execution will be of no avail; but the Court will not anticipate the merits upon such a motion.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MARSHALL, <i>Ch.
