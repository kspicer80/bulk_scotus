Trigg's debt was $6860, and the judgment against him for that sum, with $3849.10 interest and costs, with interest on the debt and damages at the rate of ten per cent. per annum, from the 23d of December, 1847, till paid.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice McLEAN delivered the opinion of the court.
