The exercise of such powers are frequently necessary, and are familiar to the profession and the courts, and when authority was given to the District Courts under this act to issue execution on final judgments or decrees that had already been rendered in their courts, it was fit and proper to confer this additional power, otherwise the final process might be unavailable. But if other powers, beyond the enforcement of the ministerial, duties of the officers, in the execution of final process, become necessary, recourse must be had to the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court. We are also of opinion that, according to the true construction of the act, the judgments or decrees there referred to are those disposing of the whole case, so that nothing is left to be done but to issue the final process; that if any proceedings remain to be taken for the purpose of completing the final disposition of it, the case or suit pending is not one within the provisions of the act.

The appeal suspends the execution of the decree. This is not a case where security is to be given in order to supersede the execution. That rule applies in cases where the decree or judgment is against the party appealing, and who desires to suspend the issuing of execution by the adverse party until the appeal is heard and determined. It is true that the adverse party in this cause has entered a cross-appeal, but, as the appeal already taken had superseded the execution, a bond in the cross-appeal would have been an act of supererogation.

[Appeal.]<br>THE MILWAUKEE AND MINNESOTA RAILROAD CO., Appellants,<br>v.<br>SOUTTER, who survived BRONSON &amp; SOUTTER, Trustees,<br>&amp;c. [Cross Appeal.]</p>\n    <p class=\"date\">December Term, 1863</p>\n    <div class=\"prelims\">\n      <p class=\"indent\">BRONSON along with one Soutter had filed their bill in the District Court of the United States for the District of Wisconsin (<i>the Circuit Court system not being at the time introduced into that region, but the District Courts having Circuit Court powers</i>), to foreclose a mortgage which had been given by the <i>La Crosse and Milwaukee</i> Railroad Company on a portion of their road, called the Eastern portion; the <i>Milwaukee and Minnesota</i> Railroad Company being also made defendants in the suit. The mortgage had been given to secure the holders of bonds which the former company had issued in large amounts. The evidence in the case was very voluminous, the issues complicated, and the cause severely contested. The court below had given to it patient investigation. On the 13th January, 1862, a final decree of foreclosure was entered in the said <i>District</i> Court, <i>in favor</i> of the complainants in the suit, and an appeal was taken by those complainants to this court on the 17th of the same month. The <i>Milwaukee and Minnesota</i> Railroad Company also, one of the defendants in the suit, took a cross-appeal on the 14th of September following.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the 12th of June, 1863, <i>pending the above appeals</i>, the District Court entered an order in the cause of Bronson and Soutter against the companies, &amp; c., on the petition of a third company, the Milwaukee and <i>St. Paul</i> Railroad Company, not a party to the suit, directing a receiver, into whose hands the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad and its assets had been placed, on filing the bill for the foreclosure of the mortgage, to turn over the road, its appurtenances and rolling stock, to them, the petitioners; and also directing that this last-named company, subject to the orders of the court, should operate this Eastern division of the road (the one covered by the mortgage), in connection with the Western division; and further, that the same company should, out of the revenues of the road, keep the rolling stock in good order and condition, and defray all running expenses, &amp;c.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the 5th day of October, 1863, another order was entered in the same cause, purporting to be on behalf of the appellants, directing that after disbursements of moneys arising from revenues of the Eastern division of the road to previous incumbrances and necessary expenses, the receiver pay to the holders of the bonds secured by the mortgage their proportionate share of the surplus, if any; all such payments to be credited on the decree of the court in the cause, or on such decree as might be eventually made, if the present decree should be reversed or modified; and on the 26th October another order was made directing the receiver to report, on the first Monday of January, the amount of moneys in his hands after paying previous incumbrances, &amp;c.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A motion was now made in this cause by the appellees in the first appeal, and appellants in the cross-appeal, to this court, for a writ of <i>prohibition</i> to the District Court, enjoining it against any further proceedings on the order of the 12th of June, and of the 5th and 26th of October. The motion was placed mainly upon the ground that the <i>District</i> Court possessed no jurisdiction to entertain the motion or to make the orders; and that its proceedings are <i>coram non judice</i> and void.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question involved the construction of two acts of Congress: the first passed <i>July</i> 15, 1862<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> the second passed <i>March</i> 3, 1863.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first act provided for extending the <i>Circuit</i> Court system of the United States to the State of Wisconsin, and which included it in the Eighth Circuit. One section of this act&#8212;the second provides that so much of any act of Congress as vests in the <i>District</i> Courts of the United States (of which the district in question is one) the powers and jurisdiction of the <i>Circuit</i> Courts, be and the same is hereby repealed. Another section&#8212;the third&#8212;provides that all actions, suits, prosecutions, causes, pleas, process, and <i>other</i> proceedings, relative to any cause, civil or criminal (which might or could have been originally cognizable in a Circuit Court), <i>now pending in or returnable to the several District Courts</i> (of which the district in question is one), acting as Circuit Courts, on the first day of October next, shall be and are hereby declared to be <i>transferable, returnable, and continued</i> to the <i>Circuit</i> Courts, &amp;c.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[This court had already held, at the last term, in a case in which the question arose, that the second section repealed in terms all the Circuit Court powers and jurisdiction of the District Courts.]</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>second</i> of the two acts referred to was entitled 'An act to enable the <i>District</i> Courts of the United States to issue executions and other final process in certain cases,' and provides, 'that in all cases wherein the District Courts <i>had rendered final judgments or decrees prior to the passage of the act of</i> 15<i>th July</i>, 1862, and which cases might have been brought in the Circuit Courts, the District Courts shall have power to issue writs of execution or other final process, or <i>to use such other powers and proceedings as may be in accordance with law, to enforce the judgments and decrees</i>.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Against the motion</i> it was argued that the act of July, 1862 the first act&#8212;gave the <i>District</i> Court, in terms, the right not only to issue writs of execution and other final process, but the right to use such '<i>other</i> powers and <i>proceedings</i>' as would enforce decrees which they had rendered prior to July 15, 1862; that the decree of foreclosure in this case was rendered prior to that date,&#8212;was made on the 13th of January preceding,&#8212;more, therefore, than six months prior; that it came accordingly within the very terms of the act.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mr. Carpenter, contra</i>.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice NELSON, after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question involves the construction of two acts of Congress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the decision of this court at the last term, it cannot be pretended that the District Court possessed any power, after the act of 15th July went into effect, to grant the orders complained of, unless it is found in the subsequent act of 3d March, 1863.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is supposed that the orders are warranted by the last clause of the act, namely, 'or to use such other powers and proceedings as may be in accordance with law, to enforce the judgments and decrees.'

Without having heard the discussion it would be impossible for him to understand a case such as he has described; and without at least the belief that he understood it, absolutely so, he hopes, for him to attempt the presentation of it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> 12 Stat. at Large, 576.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Ib., 807.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
