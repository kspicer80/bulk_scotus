With this law in force, Bindley had sued Ryan in assumpsit in the <i>Circuit</i> Court for the Southern District of Ohio, and laid his damages at <i>one</i> thousand dollars. Ryan, however, put in a plea, insisting that Ryan owed <i>him four</i> thousand dollars, which sum he claimed a right to set off against Bindley's demand, and to have judgment against Bindley for the excess: a sort of defence and judgment allowed by the laws of Ohio and the practice of the Circuit Court of the United States for its districts, which herein by rule of court had adopted the practice of the State tribunals. The verdict found $575.85 for the plaintiff.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the course of the trial the <i>defendant offered himself</i> as a witness; not being competent of course by the general laws of evidence which prevail in the Federal courts, and indeed being, by rule of the Circuit Court where the case was tried, made, as a party, specifically incompetent, but claiming to be competent by virtue of the Ohio code of civil procedure; one section of which<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> declares that 'No person shall be disqualified as a witness in any civil action or proceeding by reason of his interest in the event of the same, <i>as a party</i> or otherwise.'</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Circuit Court, holding to its own rule, rejected the witness; and on error here two questions were raised.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Did the sum involved exceed $2000 in such a sense as that the <i>Supreme</i> Court had jurisdiction?</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Was the defendant in this suit rightly rejected as a witness?</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Messrs.
