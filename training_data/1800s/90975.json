From that decree Emery appealed to that court in general term, in his own behalf; Sailer declining, in open court, to appeal. The court in general term made a decree reversing the decree in special term so far as it charged Emery, and dismissing the bill as to him. From that decree the plaintiffs have appealed to this court. It is not necessary to consider the question whether the bill, if demurred to, or if the facts alleged in it were sustained by the proofs, would lie, as setting forth a case for the cognizance of a court in equity, because we are of opinion that the proofs do not establish the allegations of the bill, so far as they affect Emery, in respect to any relief prayed against h m in the bill, or any relief granted against him by the court in special term, and that no part of the relief contended for in the assignments of error made by the appellants is warranted by the proofs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decree of the court in general term is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
