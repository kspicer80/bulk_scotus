The bill prayed that the conveyance might be aside, and the property sold in satisfaction of their debt.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complainants alleged themselves to be citizens of Ohio, and <i>Butterworth to be a citizen of Indiana, but no allegation was made in any part of the record as to the citizenship of Kelshaw</i>. The record showed, however, that he was found within the district, and had appeared and answered. The court below dismissed the bill <i>on merits</i>.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coming here, the case was argued by <i>Mr. Henderson for the complainants</i>, who asked a reversal <i>on merits</i>, which he argued had been misunderstood below, and by <i>Messrs. Ketcham and Dunn, contra</i>. The arguments need not be given, since the court considered the question not a question of merits but one</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Whether, there being no allegation of Kelshaw's citizenship, jurisdiction existed under that clause of the Judiciary Act which gives the Federal courts jurisdiction in suits between citizens of different States? and,</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. If jurisdiction did not exist, what was proper to be done; that is to say, whether the decree was to be reversed, or the bill dismissed, or the case remanded with directions, &amp;c.?</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Justice MILLER, after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear, that neither the court below, nor this court, has jurisdiction of the case as between plaintiffs and Kelshaw.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But as the court might, under some circumstances, proceed to adjudicate on the rights of the parties properly before it, we must look into the case, so far as to see if it is one in which relief may be decreed, as between plaintiffs and Butterworth, without regard to Kelshaw.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without referring to the numerous cases in this court and others, on the necessity of having all the proper parties before the court, in a suit in equity, and the circumstances under which the court will proceed in some cases, without persons who might well be made parties, it is sufficient to say that, in the present case, we think Kelshaw is properly made a defendant to this suit.
