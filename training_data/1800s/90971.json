By the Constitution of Kansas, art. 9, sec. 4, township officers, except justices of the peace, hold their offices one year from the Monday next succeeding their election, and until their successors are qualified. Jones was, therefore, presumptively in office when served, unless his removal across the line into Crawford township of itself created a vacancy. <i>Boston</i> v. <i>Buck,</i> 8 Kan. 302; <i>Rheinhart</i> v. <i>The State,</i> 14 Kan. 318; <i>Hubbard</i> v. <i>Crawford,</i> 19 Kan. 570.</p>\n<p>There is nothing in the Constitution or laws of Kansas which requires a township treasurer to be a resident of, or voter in, the township when elected or qualified; neither is there anything which vacates the office if the officer removes from the township during the term for which he was elected. Justices of the peace are township officers, and as to them it is expressly provided that they \"shall reside and hold their office in the township for which they shall have been elected.\" Sec. 4 [5970], Dassler's Comp. Laws (1879), 978. As no similar provision is made in respect to any other township officer, the implication necessarily is that actual residence in the township is not required of them. <i>Expressio unius est exclusio alterius.</i> That residence, as a qualification for office, was in the minds of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*629</span> the framers of the Constitution and of the legislature is apparent, for art. 3, sec. 11, of the Constitution, provides that all judicial officers \"shall reside in their respective townships, counties, and districts during their respective terms of office;\" art. 2, sec. 4, that \"no person shall be a member of the legislature who is not at the time of his election a qualified voter of, and resident in, the county or district for which he is elected;\" and sec. 218 [1643] of the general statutes (Dassler's Comp. Laws, 311), that \"ceasing to be an inhabitant of the county for which he was elected or appointed\" vacates the office of a county officer.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly the removal of a township treasurer from a township may, under some circumstances, vacate his office and authorize the county commissioners to fill the place (sec. 12 [5978], Dassler's Comp.

In the present case the question is whether moving \"across the line\" into an adjoining township of itself has that effect.
